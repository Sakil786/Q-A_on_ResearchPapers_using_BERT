Existing some popular microblogs like , Twitter, Facebook etc, in which twitter attains maximum amount of attention in the field of research areas related to product, movie reviews, stock exchange etc. The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present days becomes the major issue in field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on the social networking websites, huge amount of data produces in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral. We had extracted data from twitter i.e. movie reviews for sentiment prediction using machine-learning algorithms. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), maximum entropy and Naïve Bayes to classify data using unigram, bigram and hybrid i.e. unigram + bigram features. Result shows that SVM surpassed other classifiers with remarkable accuracy of 84% for movie reviews.  , I. INTRODUCTION Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups. It could be an apolitical or religious group or a group of college students, teenagers, all together sharing information of their interests, mostly online. Twitter, MySpace or Facebook are some of the social networking sites that are free of charge and easy to access. This interaction is likely to include friendship, families, group relation and romantic ones. Social networking helps people to make new friends and develop some personal relationships and stay in touch with family very easily. Due to vast number of people connects to networking sites, number of relationships gradually increases. Social networking features combined in one website are: user groups, the latest info about music groups, places for videos and photos, blogs, personal profile, and much more. Social networking sites also helps people for maintaining and developing business contacts contact with them. LinkedIn is the best example for this, as it can be suitable place to talk about business and meet with professionals. , It is easier and faster to be involving with new business clients. , Internet is foremost and first communication technology with the capability to change social interaction of the people. Since early , 1990s, there has been a proliferation of internet. For example,by , 2003 63% of American had used the internet. In 1990s, , Information technology experts expected the internet to be consigned to the trash heap of history. Internet has become an essential part of our lives; many websites have facility ways for people to keep in touch in the form of social networking. Social networking sites are the way for interact with new people and to make connections as well as share photos, videos, and activities with each other. , According to Amanda Lenhart and Mary Madden,  55% of online teenagers have created a personal profile online, and 55% have used social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. , A social networking site includes both the exchange of information among individuals and groups online. Expression also represents a view perspective, reflection, or quality of the individual or groups.  Figure 1: Abstract view of social networking , In 1997, first social site was launched named sixdegree.com. , The intention of this site was to make online dating smoother, and for the first time users were able to create their personal profile and then post it online and even surf the network. After sixdegree.com, other social sites were launched, and served for a while, and failed to become a sustainable business entity. Since then Ryze.com (2002), match.com, were launched and used by many users. Uncontrolled use of microblogging separates the users from the real world life and creates shortage of attention. , Use of social networking site has disadvantages and advantages. , It is up to the interest and knowledge of the user to know how to use them, when and which site to use. , Social networking has some of the advantages like the meeting places but virtually where people can share thoughts with whoever they want and meet them in the first place. Some people used social networking sites to make new friends, establish relationships and even marry. Some of them used this websites, in order to find their lost friends in their life and meet them. Use of social networking makes life faster and easier to get the latest news across the world at any moment and being updated. Nowadays, colleges and universities are getting fond of social networking, which makes it easier for faculty and students to find information freely and easily. Corporate and technical sectors also started recruiting employees with the help of social networking by going through  their profile and background. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:9      , Since social networking sites are operating worldwide; it breaks some of the cultural  , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families barriers around the different parts of the world. , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families easily and without any cost. Social networking brings the world together and modifies communication. Everything in the world has both advantages and disadvantages, even for social networking, the disadvantages are as follows; personal identity theft is the most popular one. , Social networking requires user‟s personal details in order to gain full access to the site as sign up. Recent information and news disclosed that some of the social networking websites misuses the personal information of users. Advertisers evade users‟ privacy. Sex offenders and criminals often visit the sites to find new victims. Some people mostly young ones for the sake of revenge and hate post embarrassing information or photos. These types of crimes can be categorized as cyber bullying in social networking makes this much faster and easier, unfortunately sometimes even led to death of teens. The developers made the social networking sites for better communication but people are rather addicted to those sites. This will hinder the ability of young people to develop real social life, face to face meeting of people, which is very important in developing conversation and speech. The traditional face to face socializing is becoming obsolete.  , Online Microblogging , Online microblogging is broadcast medium that exists similar to blogging.  Microblogging is different from blogging as its content normally smaller in both total and actual file size. , Microblogs allow users to share small chunks of content such as video link, individual images or short messages, which may be the major reason for their popularity.   , Advantages of Microblogging over traditional blogging:- Why would anyone want to start posting on a microblogging site? If you've been hesitant to jump on on a site like Twitter or , Tumblr, here are a few reasons to consider trying them , Developing content takes less time: The traditional blogs are quite lengthy so that it takes time to complete our intent. , Microblogging gives you the benefit of posting the most recently happened incident to aware your loved ones in a short time and message.   Individual parts of the content consumed in less time : Hence, microblogging  is such a popular and interactive form of information consumption and social media on mobile devices, because as the gist of the content to the people increases, therefore it is best way where the news comes in short and precise way as compare to long ones that takes time.  Increases chances of frequent posts: Microblogging involves the more frequent posts and shorter ones whereas traditional blogging involves exactly opposite less frequent post and longer. Since you're saving so much time by focusing on just posting short pieces, you `can afford to post more frequently.  Share time sensitive or urgent information in an easier way: Huge number of microblogging platforms have been made to be fast and easy to use. With a Vine video, Tumblr post, Instagram photo or a simple tweet, you can easily share to everyone on what's happening in your life or any news at this very moment.  Communication with followers becomes easy and direct : In addition to communicate easily with greater short and frequent posts, microblogging platforms can be used  easily to encourage and facilitate better  interaction  through liking, reblogging , tweeting , commenting and more.  Convenient using with mobile and tabs: Microblogging gains too much of attention in present days and the main cause behind this is increasing trends of mobile browsing. It is difficult to consume, interact and write long and lengthy blog post in a tab or smartphone that‟s why microblogging comes into play and provide small, easy and faster posts.  , Twitter , Twitter is an online microblogging service that allows users to read and write short sentences of length 140 characters called tweets. Twitter Inc. is located at San Francisco. Users should register first to post any message, whereas unregistered users can only read them. Users can access Twitter with the website interface, mobile application or SMS. Twitter was created by , Noah Glass, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey in , March 2006 and launched in July 2006. Twitter has 310 Million monthly active users, 1 billion unique visits monthly to sites with embedded tweets, 83% of active users access through mobile application, consists of 3500 employees around the world, more than 35 offices across the world, 79% accounts are from outside the U.S. , supports more than 40 languages and , 40% employees of Twitter are from technical background. All numbers approximate as of March 31, 2016. , The company experienced rapid initial growth. In year 2007 around 4,00,000 tweets were posted per quarter. In 2008 this extends to 10 million tweets a quarter. 50 millions tweets were posted per day in February 2010. 70000 applications were registered by company as March 2010. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:10       Figure 2: Twitter Logo , According to Twitter, 750 tweets are posted each second which equals to each day around 65 million tweets were posted as of , June 2010. On daily basis around 140 tweets were posted by , March 2011. In January 2009, since it gained a lot of popularity, , Twitter becomes third-highest online microblogging site, given by Compete.com. , The reason we are using microblogging and Twitter data are the following:  The scope of microblogging tends to grow bigger and bigger day by day. Easy to use and people can share and give opinions on a certain topic, thus it makes essential source.  Twitter generates vast number of messages that is increasing exponentially. The extracted data can be enormously large.  Twitter users varies from person to person as user can be politicians, film stars, celebrities, sportsmen and many leaders across the country. So, it contains all the messages of different caste, religion and sex.  Twitter users are all over the world so it contains data for different language.  , Sentiment Analysis , Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. Users share the things about their ongoing life, discuss current issues and variety of topics. , Independent to write in any format without following rules that makes this more popular than older blogging sites. Movies and product reviews easily available now a days or thoughts on religious and political issues, so it becomes essential sources of user sentiment and opinion. Data that are we using in our experiment are from Twitter, it contains a vast number of messages by large number of users created by themselves. , Messages can vary from public opinion to personal thought. , These microblogging sites are huge source of information and it is quite easy to say that there is a need for automating the sentiment analysis process as there is too much work involved in processing this information manually. Various approaches are practiced for the automation of this process like machine learning and natural language processing. Users are increasing day by day as the population and trend of using microblogging sites are increasing, so the data can be used in research purpose of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. , In the time of election every news channel show the exit polls of every political party. So, every political party willing to know how many are in favor can do so  with the help of microblogging sites where people will give their opinions about likes and dislikes of theirs party. These opinions will help parties to increase their voters. , The data we are using in this experiment are movie reviews. We have collected about 17000 movie reviews from Twitter. The movie reviews contains categorized in three ways: reviews of different movies. Reviews can be categorized in three ways: , 1. Positive reviews: Messages in which people liked the movie. , 2. Negative reviews: Messages in which people not liked the movie. , 3. Neutral reviews: Messages in which people do not have emotions or based on mere fact. , We have extracted 5000 each positive, negative and neutral reviews for training set and 2000 reviews will be used in test set. , We show comparison between the different machine learning classifiers and empirically conclude which will give the best result among these. , II. RESEARCH PROBLEM Problem Statement , Microblogging is type of blogging which consists of a limited number of words. Limitation of words determined by respective microblogging sites. It gives right to share his/her thoughts, opinions and sentiments in less number of words. It is one of the revolutionary things happening in the world of technology. , People these days depend upon microblogging sites such as , Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. to communicate with both relatives and rest of world. Here sentiments come into the play which will be shared by anyone in the time they feel and wanted it to be shared. Sentiments are nothing but feelings with respect to event or situation. Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. , The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present day is a prominent issue in the field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on social networking websites, a huge amount of data produced in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral.  , Gap Analysis , A lot of research has been done in the area of sentiment analysis. , Many researchers used Part-Of-Speech and polarity based feature using supervised learning techniques for classifying. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:11      , Many automatic classifiers are proposed for classifying the texts in the given expressions but with the restricted domains, but there will be new informal words that are added to the present world which means something in the common social network, so there is a need to include all the common referred terms that are used in the social networking world.  , Objectives , The objectives of the paper has been discussed in the following points :- , 1. To explore, analyze and study the existing sentiment analysis detection techniques in the online microblogging network. , 2. To study how the tweets can be generated from the Twitter with the help of Java API. , 3. To implement and analyze the results achieved after applying the supervised , 4. Learning classifiers to the dataset.  , III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The main aim of this paper is to compare the results that are implemented with the help of supervised classifier. , The paper follows the following methodology : , 1. We have collected a corpus of positive, negative and neutral tweets with the help of Twitter4j java API from , Twitter. The size of our corpus is large. , 2. We then remove the stop words from the collected corpus to make the content free from commas, full stops etc. , 3. Lastly, we  apply machine learning algorithms to our training set first and then test set and compare the results. , With the help of results we evaluate which machine learning algorithm is best for classification of data.  , Preprocessing , Collection of data: We collected data from Twitter API named as Twitter4j using netbeans. given by using Hashtag(#) followed by the movie name like #FAN, #BajarangiBhaijaan, #TheJungleBook etc. Approx 17000 tweets have been collected from the various movie tweets. , Reviews can also be searched by #Hash tags followed by respective movie stars, directors, production‟s house and music record companies. In Twitter, hash tags become the necessary symbol to find about something and it gives user limit of 140 words to express their views and attitude.  , Normalization , We have found that to get desired results from the classifier we have to make sure that  the tweets can be processed properly. As tweets can be in user language, so we have to clean the data which is irrelevant to the classification. The things which can be irrelevant are as follows :-  URL: URLs in the message will not make any sense as it simply distracts the result of classifier.  Username: Removal of username can be necessary for cleaning purposes as it can effect falsely to our results.  Repeated characters: If the character is repeated more than two times then it can  comprise new word but the meaning is the same, so we have to eliminate that word and make the word genuine. For example „good‟ can be written as „gooooood‟.  , Repeated words If the message contains word which has appeared more than two times continuously then it has to be changed into two times. For example, „great great great great movie‟ can be converted to „great great movie‟.  , Removal of stop words , Stop words are words like “a”, ”is”, ”the”, “etc” etc; These words have nothing to do with the emotion , so has to be discarded from the message. Now, the next step is to train the data using supervised classifier.  , Machine Learning Techniques , We employed classification methods which is polarity based using set of positive, negative and neutral tweets provided by , Twitter4j API. Polarity is given by ratio of probability of a word appeared in set of positive or negative statement which makes the word positive or negative. The classifiers we are using are based on the concept of polarity. , If the feature is independent and based only on Standard English , ...]</td>\n",

However, currently availab le algorithms focus basically on the recognition of modern coins. To date, no optical recognition system fo r coins has been researched successfully. In this paper, an algorithm based on unequally spaced frequency Fourier transforms is proposed for the recognition of coins. The performance of proposed algorithm is measured in terms of mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio.  Keywords : Coin, Feature Extraction, Neural Network, Recognition, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)  , I.   INTRODUCTION  , Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our life. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines etc. In-spite of daily uses, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purpose by the organizations that deal with the ancient coins. The three main coin recognition systems are mechanical method based systems, electromagnetic method based systems and image processing based systems   [4]   [5].   , The   mechanical   method   based systems use parameters like diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of the coin to differentiate between the coins. But these parameters cannot be used to differentiate between the different materials of the coins i.e. if we provide two coins original and the fake having same diameter, thickness, weight and  magnetism but  with  different  materials then  such system will not be able to differentiate the original co in. The electromagnetic method based systems can differentiate between different materials because in these systems the coins are passed through an oscillating coil at a certain frequency and different materials bring d ifferent changes in the amplitude and direction of frequency. So these changes and the other parameters   like   diameter,   thickness,   weight   and magnetis m can be used to differentiate between coins. The electromagnetic based coin recognition systems improve the accuracy of recognition but still they can be fooled by some game co ins. In the recent years coin recognition systems based on images have also come into picture [8]. In these systems, first of all the image of the coin to be recognized is taken  either by camera or by some scanning. Then these images are processed by various image processing techniques like FFT, , DCT, edge detection, segmentation etc. and further various features are extracted from the images which are used to recognize different coins.  , II.        LITERATURE S URVEY  , An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) bas e d Automated Coin  , Recognition System [2] is proposed for the recognition of , Indian Coins of denomination `1, `2, `5 and `10 with rotation invariance. Since the images are  taken from  both  sides  of  coin,  so  this system  is  capable  of  recognizing  coins  from  both sides.  Features a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  i m a g e s  u s i n g  techniques    of    Hough    Transformat ion,    Pattern  , Averaging etc.  and then  the  extracted  features  are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. An algorithm for recognit ion of the co ins of d ifferent denomination is presented [3]. The proposed system first uses a canny edge detection to generate an edge map and then uses CHT (Circu lar Hough transform) to recognize the coins and further find the radii of them. In [1], authors presented an approach based on image subtraction technique for recognition of , Indian Coins. In [7], authors presented the coin identification approach in which images of coin are taken from different angles and a databank is created. By using this databank, data is providing to the neural network fo r its training. An image based approach for coin recognition using gabor wavelet for feature extract ion is provided [6].  , III.PROPOS ED COIN RECOGNITION S YSTEM  , The fo llowing  steps are performed  in  the proposed coin recognition system:  , Step 1:   Develop a RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLA B. , Step 2: The Pre-processing of a coin image is perfo rmed for recognizing the type of coin. , Step 3: Unequally spaced frequency Fourier transform is applied. , Step  4: The  training  &amp;  testing  phase  of  neural network  with  rotation  invariance  is  applied  during coin recognition. , Step 5:  The results are displayed in the form of MSE and , PSNR , In this section we present recent approaches for coin recognition techniques, namely algorithms based on the , Eigen space approach, gradient features, contour and texture features. Finally, we discuss some preliminary   results   of   tests   performed   on   the muscle cis coin dataset.  , Research Article                                                                                                                              Volume 7 Issue No.4    , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10310                                                                 http://ijesc.org/    , 3.1 Coin detection , Hough transform is based on feature points extracted from the original image and usually, edges are used as the feature points. Various edge detection methods have been used for different applications. If Sobel filter is used to a coin image, large number of edge points are obtained from texture of the coin can be regarded as noise, which will induce a huge overhead   in   the   execution   time   of   the   Hough transform and most importantly will produce measurement errors, so technique to reduce the unwanted edge is sought. , Fig. 2 shows the result of applying Sobel filters to given input image (Fig. 1). The canny edge detector is very powerful tool for detecting edges in a noisy environment. Canny edge detector can remove most of the edge points. Canny gives thin edge as compared to the Sobel. Hence, canny edge detector has used for eliminating the unwanted edges that can result from , Sobel. Based on the smoothed image, derivatives in both the x and y direction are computed, these in turn are used to compute the gradient magnitude of the image.  Once the gradient magnitude of the image has been c o m p u t e d , a  p r o c e s s  c a l l e d  n o n  m a x i m u m  suppression is performed; in which pixels are suppressed if they do not constitute a local maximum.   Figure.1. Sample Coin image   Figure.2. Result of Sobel Filter   Figure.3. Result of Canny Edge Detection.  , The final step in the canny edge detector is to use hysteresis operator, in which p ixels are marked as edges, non edges and in-between based on threshold values. The next step is to consider each of the pixels that are in-between, if they are connected to edge pixels these are marked as edge pixels as well. The result of this edge detector is a binary image in which the white pixels closely approximate the true edges of the original image as shown in , Fig. 3.  , 3.2Coin verification , In general the appearance of one coin pattern varies considerably with respect to its grey values. These variations frequently are inhomogeneous and this suggests  that  fo r recognit ion  purposes, grey values by themselves will not give us appropriate results. On the other hand, edge information  remains more or less stable or at least degrades gracefully. So  the proposed research work is based on the detection on  edges.  In princip le any edge detector may be used for this purpose but Canny edge operator and the Laplacian of , Gaussian method provides more satisfactory results. As a result of the edge operator we either get a binary (edge) image or a list of coord inates at edge pixel locations.  , Let I : M× N → R[0,1] be an intensity image. M× N gives the  index space and  R[0,1] are  the  intensity values taken from the closed interval [0, 1]. E(x, y) ={ 1, if I(x, y) is an edge point , 0, els e   , 3.3 Coin recognition , Neural networks  give effect ive  resu lts fo r solving mult iple  class classification problems. Neural network has three types of layers: input layer, output layers and hidden layers. Hidden layer does intermediate computation before direct ing the input to output layer. Back propagation can also be considered as a generalization of delta rule. When back propagation network is cycled, an input pattern is propagated forward to the output units through the intervening input to hidden and hidden to output weights. Neural network have been widely used in image and signal processing. In our proposed work, neural network with rotation invariance is applied during coin recognition.  , IV .RES ULTS &amp;DISCUSS ION  , 4.1 Performance metrics , MSE and PSNR are the two error metrics used to compare image quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the compressed and the original image, whereas , PSNR represents a measure of the peak error and these can be computed as:   In above equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images, respectively. PSNR can be calculated as: In   the   previous   equation,   R   is   the   maximum fluctuation in the input image e.g. if the input image has a double-precision floating data type, then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255.    , 4.2 Experimental results  , Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of the outcomes of the proposed coin recognition system used for identifying the coin by using the neural networks.   , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10311                                                                 http://ijesc.org/   Figure.4.

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  , Index Terms—Computer vision, Edge detection, Image processing, Pixel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , Date of Submission: 10-10-2020                                                                           Date of Acceptance: 26-10-2020 , ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  , I. Introduction The edge detection methods has a significant role in image processing work. By using image processing, we can use computational power for variety of applications [6]. We can use edge detection techniques in different fields of industry and agriculture [16]. The purpose of edge detection is to point out the differences and to identify the physical occurrence which produces them. Image edge information contains a lot of information [4]. Edge detection must be convenient because the validity, competence, and probability of the completion of successive processing phase depends on it. The segregation of the image into the background and object is a critical step in the image interpretation. Edges are the boundary between different textures. Edge is the discontinuities in the image intensity from one pixel to another. Detection of the edges for an image may help for data compression, data segmentation, and image reconstruction [2]. Edge detection is difficult in the noisy image since both the noise and edge contain high-frequency contents. Attempt to reduce the noise results makes the image more noisy and result in distorted image. Filters are used in the process of identifying the images by pointing and locating the discontinuities which brings the changes into pixel intensity are the boundary of an image. We always need a good edges for higher level processing.  An accurate and fast edge detector can upgrade the performance for complete processing system [19]. There are a lot of edge detection techniques available and each designed with a certain type of features. Since basic of image processing for object detection is edge detection, it is pivotal to have a good grasp of the edges detection techniques. In the fig. 1, the gradient vector of an edge pixel is shown. The intensity for each pixel changes from 0 to 255 in the gradient direction. strength of the edge is indicated by the magnitude of the gradient. An edge pixel is identified by using two traits, the edge strength which is the magnitude of the gradient, and the edge direction which is the angle of the gradient. [9].   , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              7 | Page  Fig. 1 The gradient of pixel of an image  , The characteristic direction is determined by the geometry of the operator which is most sensitive to edges. Operators can be easily optimized to look for diagonal, vertical, or horizontal edges. There are many ways to perform edge detection, but the majority of the techniques can be classified into two groups: · Gradient-based edge detection: The gradient method finds edge by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. · Laplacian based edge detection: The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image [14-17]. An edge has the shape of a ramp which is one-dimensional and location can be easily highlighted by calculating the derivative of the image [11]. Assume we have the following signal, with an edge shown by the jump in intensity below:   Fig.2 Intensity jump  , If we consider the gradient of this signal (which, in one dimension, is just the first derivative concerning for to t) we get the following:     Fig.3 First derivative  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              8 | Page , II. Methodology 1. There are a lot of problems due to false edge detection, missing true edges, in edge detection techniques production of thick or thin lines are problems due to noise.  The visual comparison is analyzed in this paper which is the most  used Laplacian and Gradient-based Edge Detection techniques for problems of faulty edge detection, missing real edges, problems due to noise, and producing thick or thin lines, etc. In this paper, different edge detection algorithms are compared to find an efficient and superior edge detection algorithm. , Different edge detection method , 2.  , 2.1 Sobel operator Sobel edge detection is considered a traditional method used in image processing techniques. The Sobel kernels are suitable to detect edges along the vertical and horizontal axis. The Sobel operator is based on convolving the image with a separable, small, and integer-valued filter [13]. The Sobel uses two pairs of 3x3 kernels for x and y-direction.                                         , -1  0  +1  , -2  0  +2  , -1  0  +1  +1  +2  +1  , 0  0  0  , -1  -2  -1      , Table.1 x-direction   Table.2 y-direction the kernel is rotated by 90°.  This method is used to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction of each image pixel. The magnitude of the vector is given as:     ∆f = mag(∆f) = [Gx, 2+GY, 2]½………………….(1)  , 1.2 Prewitt edge detection , Prewitt edge method matches with Sobel edge method. Prewitt edge detection masks are one of the old and well-understood methods of detecting edges in images. It is widely used for detecting horizontal and vertical edges and gives those points where there is maximum gradient [12]. The strength of the edge at the given point is then the square root of the sum of the squares of two derivatives. , 1.3 Canny edge detector , Canny edge detection detects a wide range of edges in image. It is a multi-step algorithm which can detect edges with noise suppressed at the time [5]. It was proposed to buy Canny in 1986. the initial level, it applies a , Gaussian filter that smooths the image to wipe out the noise. The main problem with this type of edge detection approach is a high threshold misses important edges and a low threshold produces false. , 1.4 Robert edge detection , This operator executes a gradient detection using the difference between adjacent pixels in the diagonal direction [3]. In Robert edge detection, the horizontal and vertical edges are calculated individually and then put together for resulting edge detection [18]. It approximates the gradient intensity in discrete differentiation, which is obtained by the summation of squares of differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. The Roberts edge detector computes 2-D spatial gradient on the image [8]. It uses a pair of 2x2 convoluted kernels, which is like a , Sobel edge method. Roberts x, y kernels is mentioned below:                                                                                                                                                 Table.3 Gx                    Table.4 Gy   1.5 Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) , This method of edge detection was invented in 1980 by Marr and Hildreth. In this method, the Laplacian is combined with Gaussian filtering change the image where the intensity varies to detect the edges effectively. It finds the actual place of edges and testing large area around the pixels. The disadvantage of the LOG operator is that it cannot find out the orientation of edge because of the Laplacian filter. The use of gaussian operator in , LOG  formulation is to smooth the image and  use the zero crossing to the location of edges [7].   All of these techniques can be grouped into three modules      • Gradient (estimate of the 1stderivative)        • Laplacian (Zero crossing detectors) derivative)         • Image approximation algorithm +1  0    0  1  , 0  +1    -1  0  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              9 | Page                 , Table.5  , 3. Mathematical morphological operators In a morphological operation, each and every pixel in the image is compared based on the value of other pixels in its area of neighbourhood [1]. A structuring element is a special filtering tool that enhances an input image. It can be of different sizes and different shapes. In mathematical morphology, a gradient image can be considered as a topological surface where the numerical value of each pixel indicates the evaluation of their points [10]. , These are Some of the main mathematical morphological operators: , 2.1 Dilation , It is the highest value in the window. The image after dilation becomes brighter or the intensity increases because of the maximum value in the window. It expands the image and is mainly used to fill the gap. Dilation process expands image objects by changing pixels with a value of “1” from“0”. , 2.2 Erosion , It is not at all similar to dilation. It is the lowest value in the window. The image after Erosion will be darker than the original image. It shrinks or thins the image. This process shrinking objects or images by changing pixels with a value of “1” to “0”. , 2.3 Opening and closing , Both opening and closing parameters are formed by using erosion and dilation. In the opening, firstly image will be eroded and then it will be followed by dilation. And in case of closing, firstly image will be dilated and then followed by erosion. , A. Mean Squared Error , The average of the squares of the \"errors\" is measured by the mean squared error of an estimator i.e. the difference between what is estimated and estimator. The contrast happens due to randomness or as a result of the estimator doesn’t calculate information that could result in a better accurate estimate. The PSNR differ inversely with the MSE. , The mean square error is the squared error averaged over the M × N array.  , MSE=1/MN ∑ ∑ (f1(m,n)- f2(m,n))2 ………………….(1)     Where f1 (m, n) and  f2 (m, n) are the output and input images respectively and M, N are the dimensions of the image. Its value must be less. , RMSE=√MSE , B. Peak signal to noise ratio , Peak signal to noise ratio is the ratio between the power of corrupting noise and the most significant possible power of a signal. It is represented by PSNR. Here, PSNR refers to the ratio between the edge detected images i.e. the estimator output and the ground truth image which is also referred to be the estimated image. It is the logarithmic function of the peak value of the image and the mean square error. Usually, PSNR is expressed in decibel scale. PSNR can be rated by the following Equation 2: , PSNR=10 LOG(2552/MSE) ………………….(2) , Where MSE is mean square error. Its value must be high.  , Original images are shown below and algorithms are applied to it.

Comparison of Techniques          , Table.6  , For image 1 we have calculated MSE and PSNR for different methods of different edge detection techniques. In the experimental analysis, we came across to analyze that canny operators have been the most efficient and effective method for the detection of edges. Different edge detectors works better under the different cases and conditions, there cannot be any algorithm that make use of multiple edge detectors [15].           , Table.7  , Similarly, we have to calculate the same for image 2. Under this experimental analysis, we find the same that the canny operator for this method has worked out well in all aspects. , We obtained different images for different edge detection techniques. All of them are different in some aspects and the most efficient method is the canny edge detection technique in both cases. All other methods have some blur and noisy labels that affect the efficiency of the image as compared to the canny edge detection techniques.     , 7.  , ...]</td>\n",

Removal of background noise is one of the crucial task because the speech signal should not be harmed by noise signal. Typically many speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed by concentrating only on short-time magnitude spectrum or else by compensating the phase spectrum by keeping the magnitude spectrum unchanged. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique by changing both magnitude and phase spectra  to improve the quality of a speech signal by producing an modified complex spectrum. In simulation results, both objective speech quality measure PESQ and spectrogram analysis has shown the performance of an enhanced speech signal.  Keywords - speech enhancement, magnitude spectrum, phase spectrum compensation. , 1. INTRODUCTION , Speech enhancement is nothing but noise suppression technology. It perceives most  important significance to improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signal in the noise environments. Natural background noises are sounds better when compared to unwanted twisted noises such as  traffic sounds, music sounds, some other person is speaking in the background etc, which may degrades the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the desired speech signal.  , Enhancement of speech signal is based on magnitude and phase spectrum compensation to restore the original signal from several background noises. , Let the noisy speech be defined as \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 1  where  represents discrete-time signals of noisy speech,  represents original speech  represents noise component. , The discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a set of real and complex numbers of  to produce a periodic function of frequency variable. Therefore, the DSTFT of the corrupted speech signal is defined as , ⁄ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2  where  defines as the kth discrete frequency of uniformly spaced  frequencies and  is an analysis window function. Therefore by using DSTF transform Eq.(1) can be represented as , , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 3  where , , ,  and ,  represents DSTF transform’s of the total noise speech,  clean speech, and noise, respectively. The above equation is determined to describe each part of the speech signal in terms of the DSTFT magnitude spectrum and the DSTFT phase spectrum. Here, the clean speech signal ,  can be represented in terms of polar form as , | , | , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4  where | , | is the magnitude spectrum, and ∠ ,  is the phase spectrum. , Many of the existing speech enhancement algorithms to remove the noisy speech as well as to look at the effects of intelligibility of speech signal to improve the quality of the speech signal. Actually, the speech signal is converted into polar form to generate magnitude and phase spectrum of the speech signal with respect to frequency. Here, many of the speech models has been proposed for speech enhancement, which is based only on the statistical model of magnitude to produce a modified complex spectrum. Thus, the modified complex spectrum is known as the estimated clean speech spectrum. , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 112, The following are some of the existing speech enhancement algorithm which is used to change only the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech signal and then combines with the unchanged phase spectrum to form a modified complex spectrum. Boll proposed Spectral subtraction (SSUB) in 1979. The basic idea of this method is that the noisy speech signal is the combination of both clean speech and noise as shown in Eqn.(1). Now, the magnitude spectrum of noise is get subtracted by the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech. Therefore, the resultant magnitude spectrum of clean speech is combines with the unchanged phase spectrum[2] to obtain modified complex spectrum. Wiener filter[4]was proposed by Wiener. Hansen and Jensen. The basic principle of the weiner filter is to obtain an estimate of clean signal from the signal corrupted by the noise component. The estimate clean speech is obtained by minimizing the mean square error(MSE) between the desired signal  and the estimated signal ̂ . The MMSE estimator[3], which is presented by Ephraim and Malah in 1984. The MMSE method is analyzed by using short time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator to enhance the desired speech signal quality. This method is also based on statistical analysis. Doclo and Moonen further extended the Wiener method in the mutil-channel case [6]. Ephraim and Van Trees proposed the linear predictive factors to estimate the pure speech signal[7]. , Conventional speech enhancement method enhances the magnitude spectrum and usue the corrupted speech phase spectrum for signal recovery. Mainly, all the existing are used to change the magnitude spectrum of the speech signal because the phase spectrum provides less perceptual effect at high signal to noise ratio(SNR) level[8].Later, it has been found that phase spectrum is also helpful for  speech enhancement applications[9]. , This paper proposed a novel method by focusing on both components such as magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a speech signal to improve the quality and intelligibility of a speech signal. The quality of the sppech signal is measured by PESQ (Perceptual Estimation of Speech Quality) score compared with conventional methods. , 2. LITERATURE REVIEW i. Spectral subtractive algorithms: , In AMS (analysis–modification–synthesis) framework, the modulation domain processing was added by Paliwaland Schwerin[10]. To know the importance of the modulation stage for speech intelligibility, they had done three experiments, they are , 1. Investigate the relative contributions to intelligibility of the modulation magnitude , 2. Modulation phase, and  , 3. Acoustic phase spectra.   , In these 3 experiments they found that that the intelligibility of stimuli constructed from only y the modulation magnitude or phase spectra is significantly lower than the intelligibility of the acoustic magnitude spectrum. So here we can recognize that there is an effect of the modulation frame duration on intelligibility for both, the modulation magnitude and phase spectrum as the speech reconstructed from only the short-time modulation phase spectrum has highest intelligibility when long modulation frame durations (&gt;256 ms) are used. ii. Statistical-model-based algorithms , The effects of window shape and its length on the quality of phase-only and also magnitude-only reconstructed speech was investigated by Loveimi, Ahadi (Loveimi, Ahadi, 2010)[11]. The Speech signal is reconstructed through Least Square Error Estimation (LSEE) and Overlap Add (OLA) methods from its magnitude-only and phase-only spectra. If we want to reconstruct the speech from its magnitude spectrum they select sequence of random uniformly distributed numbers in the range of (−  , , ), as the phase sequence, or substitute phase spectrum with zero. iii. Subspace algorithms , The Combined TSP method gives a relatively better performance compared to temporal or spectral processing alone was invented by Krishnamoorthy &amp;  Prasanna[11]. They propose a noisy speech enhancement method by combining linear prediction (LP) residual weighting in the time domain and spectral processing in the frequency domain is used  to provide better noise suppression as well as better enhancement in the speech regions. By estimating the sum of the peaks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum, the gross level features are computed. Using the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation the fine level features are identified. This system is performed only on the high SNR regions of the spectrally processed speech. , 3. PROPOSED METHOD , In our proposed method a noisy speech signal is transformed into magnitude and phase spectrum to produce a modified complex spectrum to obtain better intelligibility and high speech quality. , The magnitude spectrum of clean speech is defined as  √2 2 1 2, 2 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 5  where ∙  and ∙  represents the modified Bessel functions of zero and first order, respectively.  can be defined as  , 1 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 6  , Implementation of Magnitude and Phase Spectrum Compensation to Achieve an Enhanced Speech Signal 113   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 where  and  can de defined as  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 7              , Fig. 1.

INTRODUCTION  , The  interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security has been increasing day by day that  leads to the creation of numerous and very diverse initiatives that focused on this  field of research[1] that includes the publication of many research works disclosing and evaluating different biometric vulnerabilities[2], [3], the proposal of new protection methods[4, 5, 6],  related book chapters[7] the publication of several standards in the area, the dedication of specific track sessions and workshops in biometric-specific and general signal processing conferences[8, 19],and the organization of competitions that focused on vulnerability assessment, the acquisition of specific datasets, the creation of groups and the laboratories specialized in the evaluation of biometric security, or there may be the existence of several European , Projects with the biometric security topic as main research interest.  , The above all these initiatives clearly highlight the importance given by all parties that involved in the development of biometrics  to the improvement of the systems security that brings  rapidly emerging technology into practical use. The speed and very low complexity of the proposed technique is an added advantage that makes it very well suited to operate on real scenarios (one of the desired characteristics of this type of methods). As we know that it does not deploy  any trait-specific property (e.g., minutiae points or face detection), the computation load needed for image processing purposes is very reduced and by   using only general image quality measures fast to compute and combined with very simple classifiers. , The system has been tested on publicly available attack databases of fingerprint and 2D face and also on real time. The proposed system has reached results fully comparable to those obtained on the same databases and here we follow the same experimental protocols by more complex trait-specific top-ranked approaches from the state-of-the-art.  , II. LITERATURE SURVEY  , In the entitled Paper Javier (Galbally Z.Wei, 2014), introduced a novel software-based multi-biometric and multi-attack protection method that targets to overcome part of limitations through the use of image quality assessment (IQA). It is not capable of operating with a very good performance under different biometric systems and also for diverse spoofing scenarios. In the paper (Poonam Dabas , Z.Wei, 2013), introduced objective methods for measuring the quality of images. In this paper, the proposed method focused on the various quality measures and an algorithm to model HVS (Human , Visual System). The properties of HVS are perceived brightness and frequency response and HVS is used to process input images. , The Approach of this paper [9] is based on the fact that hiding information in digital media requires alterations of the signal properties that introduce some form of degradation. The addition of a watermark or message leaves unique artifacts that can be detected using Image Quality Measures (IQM) is shown in this paper. The paper proves that image quality assessment can be used to discriminate between cover images and , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 50 stego-images. The paper also proves that the hypothesis that message-embedding scheme leave statistical evidence or structure in images that can be exploited for detection. In this paper [9], a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications is proposed. The index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors:  , A. Loss of Correlation Here, the degree of linear correlation between x and y is measured. Its dynamic range [-1, 1].  , B. Luminance Distortion   It will measure how close the mean luminance is between x and y. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1].  , C. Contrast Distortion It will measure how much similar are the contrasts are. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1]. The paper proves that the index outperforms the traditional method of error calculation of images for quality.  , III. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR , LIVENESS DETECTION  , In this paper, we have assumption that: “It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed.” Here, expected quality differences between real and fake samples may include: degree of sharpness, color and luminance levels, local artifacts, amount of information found in both type of images (entropy), structural distortions or natural appearance like face images captured from a mobile device will probably be over- or under-exposed; and fingerprint images captured from a gummy finger present local acquisition artifacts such as spots and patches. By following this “quality-difference” hypothesis, in the present research work we explore the potential of general image quality assessment as a protection method against different biometric attacks. Since the implemented features do not evaluate any specific property of a given biometric modality or of a specific attack so they may be computed on any image and the proposed method gives a new multi-biometric dimension. In the proposed state-of-the-art, the reasons behind the use of IQA features for liveness detection is supported by three factors:  , 1. The previous works for image manipulation detection [11, 12], and steg analysis [13, 14] in the forensic field has successfully used image quality. To an extent, various spoofing attacks like  those which involve taking a picture of a facial image displayed in a 2D device (e.g., spoofing attacks with printed face images), may be regarded as a type of image manipulation which can be effectively detected, as shown in the proposed  research work, by the use of different quality features. , 2. The previous studies in the forensic area and different features measuring trait-specific quality properties have already been used for liveness detection purposes in fingerprint  applications [5].This work gives a solid basis to the use of image quality as a protection method in biometric systems. , 3. As human observers very often refer to the “different appearance” of real and fake samples to distinguish between them. So, different metrics and methods designed for IQA intend to estimate in an objective and reliable way the perceived appearance of images by humans. In the proposed system, we have used different quality measures to differentiate between real and fake images.  , IV. PROPOSED METHOD  , In this proposed method, we present a novel fake detection model which can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, using image quality assessment. In the designed system, for real time recognition, we are interfacing camera to Raspberry pi and the camera will capture face image of a person and send to controller. Face and iris of the person from the image will be recognized by the controller and the finger print module will take the finger print from the person and send to controller. Then after controller will recognize the finger print of person from the data base and if they are matched then it will display the data on display unit.   Fig.1 Architecture diagram for real time recognition from a   web camera  , A.  Proposed algorithm for real time recognition In real time recognition, at first we have collected at least 15 images from webcam and then after we have trained the collected images by using Linear , Discriminant Analysis and finally we have tested the image of the same person (again image is taken from webcam).We have grabbed fingerprint of the person , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 51 from fingerprint scanner. Step wise description is given below.  , 1) Proposed Face Recognition The process of putting a label to a known face is known as face recognition. The proposed algorithm includes the following four steps:  , I. Face Detection , II. Face preprocessing , III. Training real time faces using Linear , Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , IV. Face Recognition  , Face Detection , The process of locating a face region in an image is face detection. In the proposed system, we have used , Haar-based cascade classifier for face detection. This algorithm works for frontal faces, side-view faces, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  , Haar based cascade classifier: , It is an effective face detection method. At first, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) [15, , 19] to train the classifier. After that, we need to extract features from it. Following are the Haar features:   Fig.2.Haar features  , The above features are just like our convolutional kernel and each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. Then all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features. We need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles for each feature calculation. Integral images are introduced to solve this and it simplifies the calculation and among all calculated features, most of them are irrelevant. So we will get over 160000 features and among them, we have to select the best feature and to obtain the best feature, we apply each and every feature on all the training images. It finds the best threshold which will classify the faces to positive and negative for each feature. The concept of this classifier is that instead of using all features on a window, group the features into different stages of classifiers and apply one-by-one. , Haar based cascade classifier using openCV: , In openCV, XML files [15] are stored and contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. , There are many cascade classifier in openCV like face detector, eye detector, mouth detector, etc.  , Steps for Face Detection:  , Loading Haar detector: , Here, pre trained XML file is loaded to perform face detection.  a. Accessing the webcam , Here, we access the webcam from the computer to grab the image.  b. Detecting a face using the Haar Classifier , Before detecting face in camera frame, we should perform the following steps:  i. Grayscale color conversion , As face detection only works on grayscale images. , Therefore, we should convert the color camera frame to grayscale.  ii. Shrinking the camera image , The size of the input image determines the speed of face detection i.e. it is very slow for large images but it is very fast for small images and detection is fairly even for low resolution. Thus, we should shrink the camera image to a more reasonable size.   iii. Histogram equalization , We should perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast and brightness because face detection is not as reliable in low-light conditions. , After performing these above preprocessing steps, we can now detect the face.  iv) Face pre-processing , As face recognition is extremely vulnerable to changes in lighting conditions, face orientation, face expression, thus, it is very important to reduce these differences as much as possible. In the proposed system, we have used histogram equalization for face preprocessing. For our convenience, the proposed system only uses eye detection and we ignore other facial features like mouth, nose etc.  v) Eye detection , It is a very useful for face preprocessing, because for frontal faces we can always assume a person's eyes should be horizontal and on opposite locations of the face and should have a fairly standard position and size within a face, although there are changes in facial , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 52 expressions, lighting conditions, camera properties, distance to camera, and so on. We have used pre-trained XML files for eye detection. vi) Eye search regions , The proposed system shows both left and right eyes region with small rectangle when the system captures the image. After this step, we perform the following steps:  a) Geometrical transformation and cropping: It includes scaling, rotating, and translating the images so that the eyes are aligned and then followed by the removal of the forehead, chin, ears, and background from the face image.  b) Separate histogram equalization for left and right sides: This step standardizes the brightness and contrast on both the left- and right-hand sides of the face independently.  c) Smoothing: Here, the image noise using a bilateral filter is reduced.  d) Elliptical mask: Here, the elliptical mask removes some remaining hair and background from the face image.  vii) Training real time faces using LDA , We can easily collect the face from the camera. This step includes training phase and testing phase.  , Training phase: , Distinguishing between the faces from different people is training phase and collecting the faces from the camera is training set. After collecting faces from the camera, we should train the faces. , The proposed system is trained by using LDA.  , Linear Discriminant Analysis: , LDA is a powerful statistical face recognition technique that overcomes the limitation of Principle component analysis technique by applying the linear discriminant criterion [16].The criterion tries to maximize the ratio of the determinant of the between-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant of the within class scatter matrix of the projected samples. It helps to group images of the same class and separates images of different classes of the images. It is based on 1D eigenvector matrices that appear somewhat like faces when viewed as 2D images [12]. Its basic principle is that it calculates one special eigenvector and eigenvalue for each person. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to access internal data structures of LDA. These data structures are used for mathematical calculations. , These data structures are usually stored as floating-point numbers typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.They are often either a 1D row or column matrix.   viii) Face Recognition , In this step, we find that who a person is just from a facial image. Here we have used Fisher face algorithm for face recognition. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to recognize the faces. In openCV, there are many FaceRecognizer algorithms. , In our system, we have used Fisher face algorithm. , Face verification can be done to confirm if the result of the prediction is reliable or whether it should be taken as an unknown person.  , The facial verification can be done by reconstruction of facial images followed by calculating similarity between reconstructed images and input images. We use openCv functions to perform above steps. Thus, we have used fisher faces algorithm, it needs higher threshold so here we have used threshold, say 0.7.  , 2) Proposed Fingerprint recognition method Fingerprint is another biometric check to the system. , In the proposed system, we have used openCV for fingerprint. Here, we grab the fingerprint [18] of the person at registration time and then we verify the fingerprint at verification time in real time verification.  , Binarization:  , It is the process of converting a pixel image into binary image. At first, we grab the image from the fingerprint scanner and apply binarization. It enables us to remove any desired noise from the image and help us to make the contrast better between the kin and the wrinkled surface of the finger. In the proposed system, we have two phases: Register phase and another is verify phase.  , During register phase, fingerprint is grabbed from fingerprint scanner and features points are stored in the buffer in hexadecimal form. Now during verify phase, again the fingerprint is taken from fingerprint scanner and here also the feature points are stored in buffer in hexadecimal form. If the previous feature point values match with the current feature point then authentication is success otherwise authentication is failed.

PROPSED ALGORITHM FOR OFFLINE , DATASET  , In offline recognition, we have used publicly available dataset for both face and finger which is explained below.  , 1. Proposed Face Recognition: The proposed system includes mainly following three steps in face recognition: i)In first step, we have to find a good database of faces with multiple images for each individual. ii) The second step is to detect faces in the database images and use them to train the face recognizer. iii) The third step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.   , Dataset: , ...]</td>\n",

Existing some popular microblogs like , Twitter, Facebook etc, in which twitter attains maximum amount of attention in the field of research areas related to product, movie reviews, stock exchange etc. The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present days becomes the major issue in field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on the social networking websites, huge amount of data produces in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral. We had extracted data from twitter i.e. movie reviews for sentiment prediction using machine-learning algorithms. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), maximum entropy and Naïve Bayes to classify data using unigram, bigram and hybrid i.e. unigram + bigram features. Result shows that SVM surpassed other classifiers with remarkable accuracy of 84% for movie reviews.  , I. INTRODUCTION Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups. It could be an apolitical or religious group or a group of college students, teenagers, all together sharing information of their interests, mostly online. Twitter, MySpace or Facebook are some of the social networking sites that are free of charge and easy to access. This interaction is likely to include friendship, families, group relation and romantic ones. Social networking helps people to make new friends and develop some personal relationships and stay in touch with family very easily. Due to vast number of people connects to networking sites, number of relationships gradually increases. Social networking features combined in one website are: user groups, the latest info about music groups, places for videos and photos, blogs, personal profile, and much more. Social networking sites also helps people for maintaining and developing business contacts contact with them. LinkedIn is the best example for this, as it can be suitable place to talk about business and meet with professionals. , It is easier and faster to be involving with new business clients. , Internet is foremost and first communication technology with the capability to change social interaction of the people. Since early , 1990s, there has been a proliferation of internet. For example,by , 2003 63% of American had used the internet. In 1990s, , Information technology experts expected the internet to be consigned to the trash heap of history. Internet has become an essential part of our lives; many websites have facility ways for people to keep in touch in the form of social networking. Social networking sites are the way for interact with new people and to make connections as well as share photos, videos, and activities with each other. , According to Amanda Lenhart and Mary Madden,  55% of online teenagers have created a personal profile online, and 55% have used social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. , A social networking site includes both the exchange of information among individuals and groups online. Expression also represents a view perspective, reflection, or quality of the individual or groups.  Figure 1: Abstract view of social networking , In 1997, first social site was launched named sixdegree.com. , The intention of this site was to make online dating smoother, and for the first time users were able to create their personal profile and then post it online and even surf the network. After sixdegree.com, other social sites were launched, and served for a while, and failed to become a sustainable business entity. Since then Ryze.com (2002), match.com, were launched and used by many users. Uncontrolled use of microblogging separates the users from the real world life and creates shortage of attention. , Use of social networking site has disadvantages and advantages. , It is up to the interest and knowledge of the user to know how to use them, when and which site to use. , Social networking has some of the advantages like the meeting places but virtually where people can share thoughts with whoever they want and meet them in the first place. Some people used social networking sites to make new friends, establish relationships and even marry. Some of them used this websites, in order to find their lost friends in their life and meet them. Use of social networking makes life faster and easier to get the latest news across the world at any moment and being updated. Nowadays, colleges and universities are getting fond of social networking, which makes it easier for faculty and students to find information freely and easily. Corporate and technical sectors also started recruiting employees with the help of social networking by going through  their profile and background. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:9      , Since social networking sites are operating worldwide; it breaks some of the cultural  , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families barriers around the different parts of the world. , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families easily and without any cost. Social networking brings the world together and modifies communication. Everything in the world has both advantages and disadvantages, even for social networking, the disadvantages are as follows; personal identity theft is the most popular one. , Social networking requires user‟s personal details in order to gain full access to the site as sign up. Recent information and news disclosed that some of the social networking websites misuses the personal information of users. Advertisers evade users‟ privacy. Sex offenders and criminals often visit the sites to find new victims. Some people mostly young ones for the sake of revenge and hate post embarrassing information or photos. These types of crimes can be categorized as cyber bullying in social networking makes this much faster and easier, unfortunately sometimes even led to death of teens. The developers made the social networking sites for better communication but people are rather addicted to those sites. This will hinder the ability of young people to develop real social life, face to face meeting of people, which is very important in developing conversation and speech. The traditional face to face socializing is becoming obsolete.  , Online Microblogging , Online microblogging is broadcast medium that exists similar to blogging.  Microblogging is different from blogging as its content normally smaller in both total and actual file size. , Microblogs allow users to share small chunks of content such as video link, individual images or short messages, which may be the major reason for their popularity.   , Advantages of Microblogging over traditional blogging:- Why would anyone want to start posting on a microblogging site? If you've been hesitant to jump on on a site like Twitter or , Tumblr, here are a few reasons to consider trying them , Developing content takes less time: The traditional blogs are quite lengthy so that it takes time to complete our intent. , Microblogging gives you the benefit of posting the most recently happened incident to aware your loved ones in a short time and message.   Individual parts of the content consumed in less time : Hence, microblogging  is such a popular and interactive form of information consumption and social media on mobile devices, because as the gist of the content to the people increases, therefore it is best way where the news comes in short and precise way as compare to long ones that takes time.  Increases chances of frequent posts: Microblogging involves the more frequent posts and shorter ones whereas traditional blogging involves exactly opposite less frequent post and longer. Since you're saving so much time by focusing on just posting short pieces, you `can afford to post more frequently.  Share time sensitive or urgent information in an easier way: Huge number of microblogging platforms have been made to be fast and easy to use. With a Vine video, Tumblr post, Instagram photo or a simple tweet, you can easily share to everyone on what's happening in your life or any news at this very moment.  Communication with followers becomes easy and direct : In addition to communicate easily with greater short and frequent posts, microblogging platforms can be used  easily to encourage and facilitate better  interaction  through liking, reblogging , tweeting , commenting and more.  Convenient using with mobile and tabs: Microblogging gains too much of attention in present days and the main cause behind this is increasing trends of mobile browsing. It is difficult to consume, interact and write long and lengthy blog post in a tab or smartphone that‟s why microblogging comes into play and provide small, easy and faster posts.  , Twitter , Twitter is an online microblogging service that allows users to read and write short sentences of length 140 characters called tweets. Twitter Inc. is located at San Francisco. Users should register first to post any message, whereas unregistered users can only read them. Users can access Twitter with the website interface, mobile application or SMS. Twitter was created by , Noah Glass, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey in , March 2006 and launched in July 2006. Twitter has 310 Million monthly active users, 1 billion unique visits monthly to sites with embedded tweets, 83% of active users access through mobile application, consists of 3500 employees around the world, more than 35 offices across the world, 79% accounts are from outside the U.S. , supports more than 40 languages and , 40% employees of Twitter are from technical background. All numbers approximate as of March 31, 2016. , The company experienced rapid initial growth. In year 2007 around 4,00,000 tweets were posted per quarter. In 2008 this extends to 10 million tweets a quarter. 50 millions tweets were posted per day in February 2010. 70000 applications were registered by company as March 2010. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:10       Figure 2: Twitter Logo , According to Twitter, 750 tweets are posted each second which equals to each day around 65 million tweets were posted as of , June 2010. On daily basis around 140 tweets were posted by , March 2011. In January 2009, since it gained a lot of popularity, , Twitter becomes third-highest online microblogging site, given by Compete.com. , The reason we are using microblogging and Twitter data are the following:  The scope of microblogging tends to grow bigger and bigger day by day. Easy to use and people can share and give opinions on a certain topic, thus it makes essential source.  Twitter generates vast number of messages that is increasing exponentially. The extracted data can be enormously large.  Twitter users varies from person to person as user can be politicians, film stars, celebrities, sportsmen and many leaders across the country. So, it contains all the messages of different caste, religion and sex.  Twitter users are all over the world so it contains data for different language.  , Sentiment Analysis , Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. Users share the things about their ongoing life, discuss current issues and variety of topics. , Independent to write in any format without following rules that makes this more popular than older blogging sites. Movies and product reviews easily available now a days or thoughts on religious and political issues, so it becomes essential sources of user sentiment and opinion. Data that are we using in our experiment are from Twitter, it contains a vast number of messages by large number of users created by themselves. , Messages can vary from public opinion to personal thought. , These microblogging sites are huge source of information and it is quite easy to say that there is a need for automating the sentiment analysis process as there is too much work involved in processing this information manually. Various approaches are practiced for the automation of this process like machine learning and natural language processing. Users are increasing day by day as the population and trend of using microblogging sites are increasing, so the data can be used in research purpose of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. , In the time of election every news channel show the exit polls of every political party. So, every political party willing to know how many are in favor can do so  with the help of microblogging sites where people will give their opinions about likes and dislikes of theirs party. These opinions will help parties to increase their voters. , The data we are using in this experiment are movie reviews. We have collected about 17000 movie reviews from Twitter. The movie reviews contains categorized in three ways: reviews of different movies. Reviews can be categorized in three ways: , 1. Positive reviews: Messages in which people liked the movie. , 2. Negative reviews: Messages in which people not liked the movie. , 3. Neutral reviews: Messages in which people do not have emotions or based on mere fact. , We have extracted 5000 each positive, negative and neutral reviews for training set and 2000 reviews will be used in test set. , We show comparison between the different machine learning classifiers and empirically conclude which will give the best result among these. , II. RESEARCH PROBLEM Problem Statement , Microblogging is type of blogging which consists of a limited number of words. Limitation of words determined by respective microblogging sites. It gives right to share his/her thoughts, opinions and sentiments in less number of words. It is one of the revolutionary things happening in the world of technology. , People these days depend upon microblogging sites such as , Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. to communicate with both relatives and rest of world. Here sentiments come into the play which will be shared by anyone in the time they feel and wanted it to be shared. Sentiments are nothing but feelings with respect to event or situation. Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. , The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present day is a prominent issue in the field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on social networking websites, a huge amount of data produced in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral.  , Gap Analysis , A lot of research has been done in the area of sentiment analysis. , Many researchers used Part-Of-Speech and polarity based feature using supervised learning techniques for classifying. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:11      , Many automatic classifiers are proposed for classifying the texts in the given expressions but with the restricted domains, but there will be new informal words that are added to the present world which means something in the common social network, so there is a need to include all the common referred terms that are used in the social networking world.  , Objectives , The objectives of the paper has been discussed in the following points :- , 1. To explore, analyze and study the existing sentiment analysis detection techniques in the online microblogging network. , 2. To study how the tweets can be generated from the Twitter with the help of Java API. , 3. To implement and analyze the results achieved after applying the supervised , 4. Learning classifiers to the dataset.  , III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The main aim of this paper is to compare the results that are implemented with the help of supervised classifier. , The paper follows the following methodology : , 1. We have collected a corpus of positive, negative and neutral tweets with the help of Twitter4j java API from , Twitter. The size of our corpus is large. , 2. We then remove the stop words from the collected corpus to make the content free from commas, full stops etc. , 3. Lastly, we  apply machine learning algorithms to our training set first and then test set and compare the results. , With the help of results we evaluate which machine learning algorithm is best for classification of data.  , Preprocessing , Collection of data: We collected data from Twitter API named as Twitter4j using netbeans. given by using Hashtag(#) followed by the movie name like #FAN, #BajarangiBhaijaan, #TheJungleBook etc. Approx 17000 tweets have been collected from the various movie tweets. , Reviews can also be searched by #Hash tags followed by respective movie stars, directors, production‟s house and music record companies. In Twitter, hash tags become the necessary symbol to find about something and it gives user limit of 140 words to express their views and attitude.  , Normalization , We have found that to get desired results from the classifier we have to make sure that  the tweets can be processed properly. As tweets can be in user language, so we have to clean the data which is irrelevant to the classification. The things which can be irrelevant are as follows :-  URL: URLs in the message will not make any sense as it simply distracts the result of classifier.  Username: Removal of username can be necessary for cleaning purposes as it can effect falsely to our results.  Repeated characters: If the character is repeated more than two times then it can  comprise new word but the meaning is the same, so we have to eliminate that word and make the word genuine. For example „good‟ can be written as „gooooood‟.  , Repeated words If the message contains word which has appeared more than two times continuously then it has to be changed into two times. For example, „great great great great movie‟ can be converted to „great great movie‟.  , Removal of stop words , Stop words are words like “a”, ”is”, ”the”, “etc” etc; These words have nothing to do with the emotion , so has to be discarded from the message. Now, the next step is to train the data using supervised classifier.  , Machine Learning Techniques , We employed classification methods which is polarity based using set of positive, negative and neutral tweets provided by , Twitter4j API. Polarity is given by ratio of probability of a word appeared in set of positive or negative statement which makes the word positive or negative. The classifiers we are using are based on the concept of polarity. , If the feature is independent and based only on Standard English , ...]\n",

However, currently availab le algorithms focus basically on the recognition of modern coins. To date, no optical recognition system fo r coins has been researched successfully. In this paper, an algorithm based on unequally spaced frequency Fourier transforms is proposed for the recognition of coins. The performance of proposed algorithm is measured in terms of mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio.  Keywords : Coin, Feature Extraction, Neural Network, Recognition, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)  , I.   INTRODUCTION  , Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our life. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines etc. In-spite of daily uses, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purpose by the organizations that deal with the ancient coins. The three main coin recognition systems are mechanical method based systems, electromagnetic method based systems and image processing based systems   [4]   [5].   , The   mechanical   method   based systems use parameters like diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of the coin to differentiate between the coins. But these parameters cannot be used to differentiate between the different materials of the coins i.e. if we provide two coins original and the fake having same diameter, thickness, weight and  magnetism but  with  different  materials then  such system will not be able to differentiate the original co in. The electromagnetic method based systems can differentiate between different materials because in these systems the coins are passed through an oscillating coil at a certain frequency and different materials bring d ifferent changes in the amplitude and direction of frequency. So these changes and the other parameters   like   diameter,   thickness,   weight   and magnetis m can be used to differentiate between coins. The electromagnetic based coin recognition systems improve the accuracy of recognition but still they can be fooled by some game co ins. In the recent years coin recognition systems based on images have also come into picture [8]. In these systems, first of all the image of the coin to be recognized is taken  either by camera or by some scanning. Then these images are processed by various image processing techniques like FFT, , DCT, edge detection, segmentation etc. and further various features are extracted from the images which are used to recognize different coins.  , II.        LITERATURE S URVEY  , An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) bas e d Automated Coin  , Recognition System [2] is proposed for the recognition of , Indian Coins of denomination `1, `2, `5 and `10 with rotation invariance. Since the images are  taken from  both  sides  of  coin,  so  this system  is  capable  of  recognizing  coins  from  both sides.  Features a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  i m a g e s  u s i n g  techniques    of    Hough    Transformat ion,    Pattern  , Averaging etc.  and then  the  extracted  features  are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. An algorithm for recognit ion of the co ins of d ifferent denomination is presented [3]. The proposed system first uses a canny edge detection to generate an edge map and then uses CHT (Circu lar Hough transform) to recognize the coins and further find the radii of them. In [1], authors presented an approach based on image subtraction technique for recognition of , Indian Coins. In [7], authors presented the coin identification approach in which images of coin are taken from different angles and a databank is created. By using this databank, data is providing to the neural network fo r its training. An image based approach for coin recognition using gabor wavelet for feature extract ion is provided [6].  , III.PROPOS ED COIN RECOGNITION S YSTEM  , The fo llowing  steps are performed  in  the proposed coin recognition system:  , Step 1:   Develop a RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLA B. , Step 2: The Pre-processing of a coin image is perfo rmed for recognizing the type of coin. , Step 3: Unequally spaced frequency Fourier transform is applied. , Step  4: The  training  &  testing  phase  of  neural network  with  rotation  invariance  is  applied  during coin recognition. , Step 5:  The results are displayed in the form of MSE and , PSNR , In this section we present recent approaches for coin recognition techniques, namely algorithms based on the , Eigen space approach, gradient features, contour and texture features. Finally, we discuss some preliminary   results   of   tests   performed   on   the muscle cis coin dataset.  , Research Article                                                                                                                              Volume 7 Issue No.4    , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10310                                                                 http://ijesc.org/    , 3.1 Coin detection , Hough transform is based on feature points extracted from the original image and usually, edges are used as the feature points. Various edge detection methods have been used for different applications. If Sobel filter is used to a coin image, large number of edge points are obtained from texture of the coin can be regarded as noise, which will induce a huge overhead   in   the   execution   time   of   the   Hough transform and most importantly will produce measurement errors, so technique to reduce the unwanted edge is sought. , Fig. 2 shows the result of applying Sobel filters to given input image (Fig. 1). The canny edge detector is very powerful tool for detecting edges in a noisy environment. Canny edge detector can remove most of the edge points. Canny gives thin edge as compared to the Sobel. Hence, canny edge detector has used for eliminating the unwanted edges that can result from , Sobel. Based on the smoothed image, derivatives in both the x and y direction are computed, these in turn are used to compute the gradient magnitude of the image.  Once the gradient magnitude of the image has been c o m p u t e d , a  p r o c e s s  c a l l e d  n o n  m a x i m u m  suppression is performed; in which pixels are suppressed if they do not constitute a local maximum.   Figure.1. Sample Coin image   Figure.2. Result of Sobel Filter   Figure.3. Result of Canny Edge Detection.  , The final step in the canny edge detector is to use hysteresis operator, in which p ixels are marked as edges, non edges and in-between based on threshold values. The next step is to consider each of the pixels that are in-between, if they are connected to edge pixels these are marked as edge pixels as well. The result of this edge detector is a binary image in which the white pixels closely approximate the true edges of the original image as shown in , Fig. 3.  , 3.2Coin verification , In general the appearance of one coin pattern varies considerably with respect to its grey values. These variations frequently are inhomogeneous and this suggests  that  fo r recognit ion  purposes, grey values by themselves will not give us appropriate results. On the other hand, edge information  remains more or less stable or at least degrades gracefully. So  the proposed research work is based on the detection on  edges.  In princip le any edge detector may be used for this purpose but Canny edge operator and the Laplacian of , Gaussian method provides more satisfactory results. As a result of the edge operator we either get a binary (edge) image or a list of coord inates at edge pixel locations.  , Let I : M× N → R[0,1] be an intensity image. M× N gives the  index space and  R[0,1] are  the  intensity values taken from the closed interval [0, 1]. E(x, y) ={ 1, if I(x, y) is an edge point , 0, els e   , 3.3 Coin recognition , Neural networks  give effect ive  resu lts fo r solving mult iple  class classification problems. Neural network has three types of layers: input layer, output layers and hidden layers. Hidden layer does intermediate computation before direct ing the input to output layer. Back propagation can also be considered as a generalization of delta rule. When back propagation network is cycled, an input pattern is propagated forward to the output units through the intervening input to hidden and hidden to output weights. Neural network have been widely used in image and signal processing. In our proposed work, neural network with rotation invariance is applied during coin recognition.  , IV .RES ULTS &DISCUSS ION  , 4.1 Performance metrics , MSE and PSNR are the two error metrics used to compare image quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the compressed and the original image, whereas , PSNR represents a measure of the peak error and these can be computed as:   In above equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images, respectively. PSNR can be calculated as: In   the   previous   equation,   R   is   the   maximum fluctuation in the input image e.g. if the input image has a double-precision floating data type, then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255.    , 4.2 Experimental results  , Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of the outcomes of the proposed coin recognition system used for identifying the coin by using the neural networks.   , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10311                                                                 http://ijesc.org/   Figure.4.

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  , Index Terms—Computer vision, Edge detection, Image processing, Pixel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , Date of Submission: 10-10-2020                                                                           Date of Acceptance: 26-10-2020 , ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  , I. Introduction The edge detection methods has a significant role in image processing work. By using image processing, we can use computational power for variety of applications [6]. We can use edge detection techniques in different fields of industry and agriculture [16]. The purpose of edge detection is to point out the differences and to identify the physical occurrence which produces them. Image edge information contains a lot of information [4]. Edge detection must be convenient because the validity, competence, and probability of the completion of successive processing phase depends on it. The segregation of the image into the background and object is a critical step in the image interpretation. Edges are the boundary between different textures. Edge is the discontinuities in the image intensity from one pixel to another. Detection of the edges for an image may help for data compression, data segmentation, and image reconstruction [2]. Edge detection is difficult in the noisy image since both the noise and edge contain high-frequency contents. Attempt to reduce the noise results makes the image more noisy and result in distorted image. Filters are used in the process of identifying the images by pointing and locating the discontinuities which brings the changes into pixel intensity are the boundary of an image. We always need a good edges for higher level processing.  An accurate and fast edge detector can upgrade the performance for complete processing system [19]. There are a lot of edge detection techniques available and each designed with a certain type of features. Since basic of image processing for object detection is edge detection, it is pivotal to have a good grasp of the edges detection techniques. In the fig. 1, the gradient vector of an edge pixel is shown. The intensity for each pixel changes from 0 to 255 in the gradient direction. strength of the edge is indicated by the magnitude of the gradient. An edge pixel is identified by using two traits, the edge strength which is the magnitude of the gradient, and the edge direction which is the angle of the gradient. [9].   , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              7 | Page  Fig. 1 The gradient of pixel of an image  , The characteristic direction is determined by the geometry of the operator which is most sensitive to edges. Operators can be easily optimized to look for diagonal, vertical, or horizontal edges. There are many ways to perform edge detection, but the majority of the techniques can be classified into two groups: · Gradient-based edge detection: The gradient method finds edge by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. · Laplacian based edge detection: The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image [14-17]. An edge has the shape of a ramp which is one-dimensional and location can be easily highlighted by calculating the derivative of the image [11]. Assume we have the following signal, with an edge shown by the jump in intensity below:   Fig.2 Intensity jump  , If we consider the gradient of this signal (which, in one dimension, is just the first derivative concerning for to t) we get the following:     Fig.3 First derivative  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              8 | Page , II. Methodology 1. There are a lot of problems due to false edge detection, missing true edges, in edge detection techniques production of thick or thin lines are problems due to noise.  The visual comparison is analyzed in this paper which is the most  used Laplacian and Gradient-based Edge Detection techniques for problems of faulty edge detection, missing real edges, problems due to noise, and producing thick or thin lines, etc. In this paper, different edge detection algorithms are compared to find an efficient and superior edge detection algorithm. , Different edge detection method , 2.  , 2.1 Sobel operator Sobel edge detection is considered a traditional method used in image processing techniques. The Sobel kernels are suitable to detect edges along the vertical and horizontal axis. The Sobel operator is based on convolving the image with a separable, small, and integer-valued filter [13]. The Sobel uses two pairs of 3x3 kernels for x and y-direction.                                         , -1  0  +1  , -2  0  +2  , -1  0  +1  +1  +2  +1  , 0  0  0  , -1  -2  -1      , Table.1 x-direction   Table.2 y-direction the kernel is rotated by 90°.  This method is used to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction of each image pixel. The magnitude of the vector is given as:     ∆f = mag(∆f) = [Gx, 2+GY, 2]½………………….(1)  , 1.2 Prewitt edge detection , Prewitt edge method matches with Sobel edge method. Prewitt edge detection masks are one of the old and well-understood methods of detecting edges in images. It is widely used for detecting horizontal and vertical edges and gives those points where there is maximum gradient [12]. The strength of the edge at the given point is then the square root of the sum of the squares of two derivatives. , 1.3 Canny edge detector , Canny edge detection detects a wide range of edges in image. It is a multi-step algorithm which can detect edges with noise suppressed at the time [5]. It was proposed to buy Canny in 1986. the initial level, it applies a , Gaussian filter that smooths the image to wipe out the noise. The main problem with this type of edge detection approach is a high threshold misses important edges and a low threshold produces false. , 1.4 Robert edge detection , This operator executes a gradient detection using the difference between adjacent pixels in the diagonal direction [3]. In Robert edge detection, the horizontal and vertical edges are calculated individually and then put together for resulting edge detection [18]. It approximates the gradient intensity in discrete differentiation, which is obtained by the summation of squares of differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. The Roberts edge detector computes 2-D spatial gradient on the image [8]. It uses a pair of 2x2 convoluted kernels, which is like a , Sobel edge method. Roberts x, y kernels is mentioned below:                                                                                                                                                 Table.3 Gx                    Table.4 Gy   1.5 Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) , This method of edge detection was invented in 1980 by Marr and Hildreth. In this method, the Laplacian is combined with Gaussian filtering change the image where the intensity varies to detect the edges effectively. It finds the actual place of edges and testing large area around the pixels. The disadvantage of the LOG operator is that it cannot find out the orientation of edge because of the Laplacian filter. The use of gaussian operator in , LOG  formulation is to smooth the image and  use the zero crossing to the location of edges [7].   All of these techniques can be grouped into three modules      • Gradient (estimate of the 1stderivative)        • Laplacian (Zero crossing detectors) derivative)         • Image approximation algorithm +1  0    0  1  , 0  +1    -1  0  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              9 | Page                 , Table.5  , 3. Mathematical morphological operators In a morphological operation, each and every pixel in the image is compared based on the value of other pixels in its area of neighbourhood [1]. A structuring element is a special filtering tool that enhances an input image. It can be of different sizes and different shapes. In mathematical morphology, a gradient image can be considered as a topological surface where the numerical value of each pixel indicates the evaluation of their points [10]. , These are Some of the main mathematical morphological operators: , 2.1 Dilation , It is the highest value in the window. The image after dilation becomes brighter or the intensity increases because of the maximum value in the window. It expands the image and is mainly used to fill the gap. Dilation process expands image objects by changing pixels with a value of “1” from“0”. , 2.2 Erosion , It is not at all similar to dilation. It is the lowest value in the window. The image after Erosion will be darker than the original image. It shrinks or thins the image. This process shrinking objects or images by changing pixels with a value of “1” to “0”. , 2.3 Opening and closing , Both opening and closing parameters are formed by using erosion and dilation. In the opening, firstly image will be eroded and then it will be followed by dilation. And in case of closing, firstly image will be dilated and then followed by erosion. , A. Mean Squared Error , The average of the squares of the \"errors\" is measured by the mean squared error of an estimator i.e. the difference between what is estimated and estimator. The contrast happens due to randomness or as a result of the estimator doesn’t calculate information that could result in a better accurate estimate. The PSNR differ inversely with the MSE. , The mean square error is the squared error averaged over the M × N array.  , MSE=1/MN ∑ ∑ (f1(m,n)- f2(m,n))2 ………………….(1)     Where f1 (m, n) and  f2 (m, n) are the output and input images respectively and M, N are the dimensions of the image. Its value must be less. , RMSE=√MSE , B. Peak signal to noise ratio , Peak signal to noise ratio is the ratio between the power of corrupting noise and the most significant possible power of a signal. It is represented by PSNR. Here, PSNR refers to the ratio between the edge detected images i.e. the estimator output and the ground truth image which is also referred to be the estimated image. It is the logarithmic function of the peak value of the image and the mean square error. Usually, PSNR is expressed in decibel scale. PSNR can be rated by the following Equation 2: , PSNR=10 LOG(2552/MSE) ………………….(2) , Where MSE is mean square error. Its value must be high.  , Original images are shown below and algorithms are applied to it.

Comparison of Techniques          , Table.6  , For image 1 we have calculated MSE and PSNR for different methods of different edge detection techniques. In the experimental analysis, we came across to analyze that canny operators have been the most efficient and effective method for the detection of edges. Different edge detectors works better under the different cases and conditions, there cannot be any algorithm that make use of multiple edge detectors [15].           , Table.7  , Similarly, we have to calculate the same for image 2. Under this experimental analysis, we find the same that the canny operator for this method has worked out well in all aspects. , We obtained different images for different edge detection techniques. All of them are different in some aspects and the most efficient method is the canny edge detection technique in both cases. All other methods have some blur and noisy labels that affect the efficiency of the image as compared to the canny edge detection techniques.     , 7.  , ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Removal of background noise is one of the crucial task because the speech signal should not be harmed by noise signal. Typically many speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed by concentrating only on short-time magnitude spectrum or else by compensating the phase spectrum by keeping the magnitude spectrum unchanged. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique by changing both magnitude and phase spectra  to improve the quality of a speech signal by producing an modified complex spectrum. In simulation results, both objective speech quality measure PESQ and spectrogram analysis has shown the performance of an enhanced speech signal.  Keywords - speech enhancement, magnitude spectrum, phase spectrum compensation. , 1. INTRODUCTION , Speech enhancement is nothing but noise suppression technology. It perceives most  important significance to improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signal in the noise environments. Natural background noises are sounds better when compared to unwanted twisted noises such as  traffic sounds, music sounds, some other person is speaking in the background etc, which may degrades the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the desired speech signal.  , Enhancement of speech signal is based on magnitude and phase spectrum compensation to restore the original signal from several background noises. , Let the noisy speech be defined as \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 1  where  represents discrete-time signals of noisy speech,  represents original speech  represents noise component. , The discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a set of real and complex numbers of  to produce a periodic function of frequency variable. Therefore, the DSTFT of the corrupted speech signal is defined as , ⁄ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2  where  defines as the kth discrete frequency of uniformly spaced  frequencies and  is an analysis window function. Therefore by using DSTF transform Eq.(1) can be represented as , , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 3  where , , ,  and ,  represents DSTF transform’s of the total noise speech,  clean speech, and noise, respectively. The above equation is determined to describe each part of the speech signal in terms of the DSTFT magnitude spectrum and the DSTFT phase spectrum. Here, the clean speech signal ,  can be represented in terms of polar form as , | , | , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4  where | , | is the magnitude spectrum, and ∠ ,  is the phase spectrum. , Many of the existing speech enhancement algorithms to remove the noisy speech as well as to look at the effects of intelligibility of speech signal to improve the quality of the speech signal. Actually, the speech signal is converted into polar form to generate magnitude and phase spectrum of the speech signal with respect to frequency. Here, many of the speech models has been proposed for speech enhancement, which is based only on the statistical model of magnitude to produce a modified complex spectrum. Thus, the modified complex spectrum is known as the estimated clean speech spectrum. , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 112, The following are some of the existing speech enhancement algorithm which is used to change only the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech signal and then combines with the unchanged phase spectrum to form a modified complex spectrum. Boll proposed Spectral subtraction (SSUB) in 1979. The basic idea of this method is that the noisy speech signal is the combination of both clean speech and noise as shown in Eqn.(1). Now, the magnitude spectrum of noise is get subtracted by the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech. Therefore, the resultant magnitude spectrum of clean speech is combines with the unchanged phase spectrum[2] to obtain modified complex spectrum. Wiener filter[4]was proposed by Wiener. Hansen and Jensen. The basic principle of the weiner filter is to obtain an estimate of clean signal from the signal corrupted by the noise component. The estimate clean speech is obtained by minimizing the mean square error(MSE) between the desired signal  and the estimated signal ̂ . The MMSE estimator[3], which is presented by Ephraim and Malah in 1984. The MMSE method is analyzed by using short time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator to enhance the desired speech signal quality. This method is also based on statistical analysis. Doclo and Moonen further extended the Wiener method in the mutil-channel case [6]. Ephraim and Van Trees proposed the linear predictive factors to estimate the pure speech signal[7]. , Conventional speech enhancement method enhances the magnitude spectrum and usue the corrupted speech phase spectrum for signal recovery. Mainly, all the existing are used to change the magnitude spectrum of the speech signal because the phase spectrum provides less perceptual effect at high signal to noise ratio(SNR) level[8].Later, it has been found that phase spectrum is also helpful for  speech enhancement applications[9]. , This paper proposed a novel method by focusing on both components such as magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a speech signal to improve the quality and intelligibility of a speech signal. The quality of the sppech signal is measured by PESQ (Perceptual Estimation of Speech Quality) score compared with conventional methods. , 2. LITERATURE REVIEW i. Spectral subtractive algorithms: , In AMS (analysis–modification–synthesis) framework, the modulation domain processing was added by Paliwaland Schwerin[10]. To know the importance of the modulation stage for speech intelligibility, they had done three experiments, they are , 1. Investigate the relative contributions to intelligibility of the modulation magnitude , 2. Modulation phase, and  , 3. Acoustic phase spectra.   , In these 3 experiments they found that that the intelligibility of stimuli constructed from only y the modulation magnitude or phase spectra is significantly lower than the intelligibility of the acoustic magnitude spectrum. So here we can recognize that there is an effect of the modulation frame duration on intelligibility for both, the modulation magnitude and phase spectrum as the speech reconstructed from only the short-time modulation phase spectrum has highest intelligibility when long modulation frame durations (>256 ms) are used. ii. Statistical-model-based algorithms , The effects of window shape and its length on the quality of phase-only and also magnitude-only reconstructed speech was investigated by Loveimi, Ahadi (Loveimi, Ahadi, 2010)[11]. The Speech signal is reconstructed through Least Square Error Estimation (LSEE) and Overlap Add (OLA) methods from its magnitude-only and phase-only spectra. If we want to reconstruct the speech from its magnitude spectrum they select sequence of random uniformly distributed numbers in the range of (−  , , ), as the phase sequence, or substitute phase spectrum with zero. iii. Subspace algorithms , The Combined TSP method gives a relatively better performance compared to temporal or spectral processing alone was invented by Krishnamoorthy &  Prasanna[11]. They propose a noisy speech enhancement method by combining linear prediction (LP) residual weighting in the time domain and spectral processing in the frequency domain is used  to provide better noise suppression as well as better enhancement in the speech regions. By estimating the sum of the peaks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum, the gross level features are computed. Using the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation the fine level features are identified. This system is performed only on the high SNR regions of the spectrally processed speech. , 3. PROPOSED METHOD , In our proposed method a noisy speech signal is transformed into magnitude and phase spectrum to produce a modified complex spectrum to obtain better intelligibility and high speech quality. , The magnitude spectrum of clean speech is defined as  √2 2 1 2, 2 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 5  where ∙  and ∙  represents the modified Bessel functions of zero and first order, respectively.  can be defined as  , 1 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 6  , Implementation of Magnitude and Phase Spectrum Compensation to Achieve an Enhanced Speech Signal 113   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 where  and  can de defined as  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 7              , Fig. 1.

The output of this may be complex because it is in time representation. So in PSC method the imaginary part is removed. And the final result, i.e enhanced time domain signal is obtained by applying overlap-Add method procedure, ̂ . 4. DISCUSSION , 1. A clean speech is corrupted by the noise at the receiver section.

INTRODUCTION  , The  interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security has been increasing day by day that  leads to the creation of numerous and very diverse initiatives that focused on this  field of research[1] that includes the publication of many research works disclosing and evaluating different biometric vulnerabilities[2], [3], the proposal of new protection methods[4, 5, 6],  related book chapters[7] the publication of several standards in the area, the dedication of specific track sessions and workshops in biometric-specific and general signal processing conferences[8, 19],and the organization of competitions that focused on vulnerability assessment, the acquisition of specific datasets, the creation of groups and the laboratories specialized in the evaluation of biometric security, or there may be the existence of several European , Projects with the biometric security topic as main research interest.  , The above all these initiatives clearly highlight the importance given by all parties that involved in the development of biometrics  to the improvement of the systems security that brings  rapidly emerging technology into practical use. The speed and very low complexity of the proposed technique is an added advantage that makes it very well suited to operate on real scenarios (one of the desired characteristics of this type of methods). As we know that it does not deploy  any trait-specific property (e.g., minutiae points or face detection), the computation load needed for image processing purposes is very reduced and by   using only general image quality measures fast to compute and combined with very simple classifiers. , The system has been tested on publicly available attack databases of fingerprint and 2D face and also on real time. The proposed system has reached results fully comparable to those obtained on the same databases and here we follow the same experimental protocols by more complex trait-specific top-ranked approaches from the state-of-the-art.  , II. LITERATURE SURVEY  , In the entitled Paper Javier (Galbally Z.Wei, 2014), introduced a novel software-based multi-biometric and multi-attack protection method that targets to overcome part of limitations through the use of image quality assessment (IQA). It is not capable of operating with a very good performance under different biometric systems and also for diverse spoofing scenarios. In the paper (Poonam Dabas , Z.Wei, 2013), introduced objective methods for measuring the quality of images. In this paper, the proposed method focused on the various quality measures and an algorithm to model HVS (Human , Visual System). The properties of HVS are perceived brightness and frequency response and HVS is used to process input images. , The Approach of this paper [9] is based on the fact that hiding information in digital media requires alterations of the signal properties that introduce some form of degradation. The addition of a watermark or message leaves unique artifacts that can be detected using Image Quality Measures (IQM) is shown in this paper. The paper proves that image quality assessment can be used to discriminate between cover images and , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 50 stego-images. The paper also proves that the hypothesis that message-embedding scheme leave statistical evidence or structure in images that can be exploited for detection. In this paper [9], a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications is proposed. The index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors:  , A. Loss of Correlation Here, the degree of linear correlation between x and y is measured. Its dynamic range [-1, 1].  , B. Luminance Distortion   It will measure how close the mean luminance is between x and y. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1].  , C. Contrast Distortion It will measure how much similar are the contrasts are. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1]. The paper proves that the index outperforms the traditional method of error calculation of images for quality.  , III. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR , LIVENESS DETECTION  , In this paper, we have assumption that: “It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed.” Here, expected quality differences between real and fake samples may include: degree of sharpness, color and luminance levels, local artifacts, amount of information found in both type of images (entropy), structural distortions or natural appearance like face images captured from a mobile device will probably be over- or under-exposed; and fingerprint images captured from a gummy finger present local acquisition artifacts such as spots and patches. By following this “quality-difference” hypothesis, in the present research work we explore the potential of general image quality assessment as a protection method against different biometric attacks. Since the implemented features do not evaluate any specific property of a given biometric modality or of a specific attack so they may be computed on any image and the proposed method gives a new multi-biometric dimension. In the proposed state-of-the-art, the reasons behind the use of IQA features for liveness detection is supported by three factors:  , 1. The previous works for image manipulation detection [11, 12], and steg analysis [13, 14] in the forensic field has successfully used image quality. To an extent, various spoofing attacks like  those which involve taking a picture of a facial image displayed in a 2D device (e.g., spoofing attacks with printed face images), may be regarded as a type of image manipulation which can be effectively detected, as shown in the proposed  research work, by the use of different quality features. , 2. The previous studies in the forensic area and different features measuring trait-specific quality properties have already been used for liveness detection purposes in fingerprint  applications [5].This work gives a solid basis to the use of image quality as a protection method in biometric systems. , 3. As human observers very often refer to the “different appearance” of real and fake samples to distinguish between them. So, different metrics and methods designed for IQA intend to estimate in an objective and reliable way the perceived appearance of images by humans. In the proposed system, we have used different quality measures to differentiate between real and fake images.  , IV. PROPOSED METHOD  , In this proposed method, we present a novel fake detection model which can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, using image quality assessment. In the designed system, for real time recognition, we are interfacing camera to Raspberry pi and the camera will capture face image of a person and send to controller. Face and iris of the person from the image will be recognized by the controller and the finger print module will take the finger print from the person and send to controller. Then after controller will recognize the finger print of person from the data base and if they are matched then it will display the data on display unit.   Fig.1 Architecture diagram for real time recognition from a   web camera  , A.  Proposed algorithm for real time recognition In real time recognition, at first we have collected at least 15 images from webcam and then after we have trained the collected images by using Linear , Discriminant Analysis and finally we have tested the image of the same person (again image is taken from webcam).We have grabbed fingerprint of the person , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 51 from fingerprint scanner. Step wise description is given below.  , 1) Proposed Face Recognition The process of putting a label to a known face is known as face recognition. The proposed algorithm includes the following four steps:  , I. Face Detection , II. Face preprocessing , III. Training real time faces using Linear , Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , IV. Face Recognition  , Face Detection , The process of locating a face region in an image is face detection. In the proposed system, we have used , Haar-based cascade classifier for face detection. This algorithm works for frontal faces, side-view faces, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  , Haar based cascade classifier: , It is an effective face detection method. At first, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) [15, , 19] to train the classifier. After that, we need to extract features from it. Following are the Haar features:   Fig.2.Haar features  , The above features are just like our convolutional kernel and each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. Then all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features. We need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles for each feature calculation. Integral images are introduced to solve this and it simplifies the calculation and among all calculated features, most of them are irrelevant. So we will get over 160000 features and among them, we have to select the best feature and to obtain the best feature, we apply each and every feature on all the training images. It finds the best threshold which will classify the faces to positive and negative for each feature. The concept of this classifier is that instead of using all features on a window, group the features into different stages of classifiers and apply one-by-one. , Haar based cascade classifier using openCV: , In openCV, XML files [15] are stored and contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. , There are many cascade classifier in openCV like face detector, eye detector, mouth detector, etc.  , Steps for Face Detection:  , Loading Haar detector: , Here, pre trained XML file is loaded to perform face detection.  a. Accessing the webcam , Here, we access the webcam from the computer to grab the image.  b. Detecting a face using the Haar Classifier , Before detecting face in camera frame, we should perform the following steps:  i. Grayscale color conversion , As face detection only works on grayscale images. , Therefore, we should convert the color camera frame to grayscale.  ii. Shrinking the camera image , The size of the input image determines the speed of face detection i.e. it is very slow for large images but it is very fast for small images and detection is fairly even for low resolution. Thus, we should shrink the camera image to a more reasonable size.   iii. Histogram equalization , We should perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast and brightness because face detection is not as reliable in low-light conditions. , After performing these above preprocessing steps, we can now detect the face.  iv) Face pre-processing , As face recognition is extremely vulnerable to changes in lighting conditions, face orientation, face expression, thus, it is very important to reduce these differences as much as possible. In the proposed system, we have used histogram equalization for face preprocessing. For our convenience, the proposed system only uses eye detection and we ignore other facial features like mouth, nose etc.  v) Eye detection , It is a very useful for face preprocessing, because for frontal faces we can always assume a person's eyes should be horizontal and on opposite locations of the face and should have a fairly standard position and size within a face, although there are changes in facial , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 52 expressions, lighting conditions, camera properties, distance to camera, and so on. We have used pre-trained XML files for eye detection. vi) Eye search regions , The proposed system shows both left and right eyes region with small rectangle when the system captures the image. After this step, we perform the following steps:  a) Geometrical transformation and cropping: It includes scaling, rotating, and translating the images so that the eyes are aligned and then followed by the removal of the forehead, chin, ears, and background from the face image.  b) Separate histogram equalization for left and right sides: This step standardizes the brightness and contrast on both the left- and right-hand sides of the face independently.  c) Smoothing: Here, the image noise using a bilateral filter is reduced.  d) Elliptical mask: Here, the elliptical mask removes some remaining hair and background from the face image.  vii) Training real time faces using LDA , We can easily collect the face from the camera. This step includes training phase and testing phase.  , Training phase: , Distinguishing between the faces from different people is training phase and collecting the faces from the camera is training set. After collecting faces from the camera, we should train the faces. , The proposed system is trained by using LDA.  , Linear Discriminant Analysis: , LDA is a powerful statistical face recognition technique that overcomes the limitation of Principle component analysis technique by applying the linear discriminant criterion [16].The criterion tries to maximize the ratio of the determinant of the between-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant of the within class scatter matrix of the projected samples. It helps to group images of the same class and separates images of different classes of the images. It is based on 1D eigenvector matrices that appear somewhat like faces when viewed as 2D images [12]. Its basic principle is that it calculates one special eigenvector and eigenvalue for each person. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to access internal data structures of LDA. These data structures are used for mathematical calculations. , These data structures are usually stored as floating-point numbers typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.They are often either a 1D row or column matrix.   viii) Face Recognition , In this step, we find that who a person is just from a facial image. Here we have used Fisher face algorithm for face recognition. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to recognize the faces. In openCV, there are many FaceRecognizer algorithms. , In our system, we have used Fisher face algorithm. , Face verification can be done to confirm if the result of the prediction is reliable or whether it should be taken as an unknown person.  , The facial verification can be done by reconstruction of facial images followed by calculating similarity between reconstructed images and input images. We use openCv functions to perform above steps. Thus, we have used fisher faces algorithm, it needs higher threshold so here we have used threshold, say 0.7.  , 2) Proposed Fingerprint recognition method Fingerprint is another biometric check to the system. , In the proposed system, we have used openCV for fingerprint. Here, we grab the fingerprint [18] of the person at registration time and then we verify the fingerprint at verification time in real time verification.  , Binarization:  , It is the process of converting a pixel image into binary image. At first, we grab the image from the fingerprint scanner and apply binarization. It enables us to remove any desired noise from the image and help us to make the contrast better between the kin and the wrinkled surface of the finger. In the proposed system, we have two phases: Register phase and another is verify phase.  , During register phase, fingerprint is grabbed from fingerprint scanner and features points are stored in the buffer in hexadecimal form. Now during verify phase, again the fingerprint is taken from fingerprint scanner and here also the feature points are stored in buffer in hexadecimal form. If the previous feature point values match with the current feature point then authentication is success otherwise authentication is failed.

PROPSED ALGORITHM FOR OFFLINE , DATASET  , In offline recognition, we have used publicly available dataset for both face and finger which is explained below.  , 1. Proposed Face Recognition: The proposed system includes mainly following three steps in face recognition: i)In first step, we have to find a good database of faces with multiple images for each individual. ii) The second step is to detect faces in the database images and use them to train the face recognizer. iii) The third step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.   , Dataset: , ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "

Existing some popular microblogs like , Twitter, Facebook etc, in which twitter attains maximum amount of attention in the field of research areas related to product, movie reviews, stock exchange etc. The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present days becomes the major issue in field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on the social networking websites, huge amount of data produces in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral. We had extracted data from twitter i.e. movie reviews for sentiment prediction using machine-learning algorithms. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), maximum entropy and Naïve Bayes to classify data using unigram, bigram and hybrid i.e. unigram + bigram features. Result shows that SVM surpassed other classifiers with remarkable accuracy of 84% for movie reviews.  , I. INTRODUCTION Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups. It could be an apolitical or religious group or a group of college students, teenagers, all together sharing information of their interests, mostly online. Twitter, MySpace or Facebook are some of the social networking sites that are free of charge and easy to access. This interaction is likely to include friendship, families, group relation and romantic ones. Social networking helps people to make new friends and develop some personal relationships and stay in touch with family very easily. Due to vast number of people connects to networking sites, number of relationships gradually increases. Social networking features combined in one website are: user groups, the latest info about music groups, places for videos and photos, blogs, personal profile, and much more. Social networking sites also helps people for maintaining and developing business contacts contact with them. LinkedIn is the best example for this, as it can be suitable place to talk about business and meet with professionals. , It is easier and faster to be involving with new business clients. , Internet is foremost and first communication technology with the capability to change social interaction of the people. Since early , 1990s, there has been a proliferation of internet. For example,by , 2003 63% of American had used the internet. In 1990s, , Information technology experts expected the internet to be consigned to the trash heap of history. Internet has become an essential part of our lives; many websites have facility ways for people to keep in touch in the form of social networking. Social networking sites are the way for interact with new people and to make connections as well as share photos, videos, and activities with each other. , According to Amanda Lenhart and Mary Madden,  55% of online teenagers have created a personal profile online, and 55% have used social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. , A social networking site includes both the exchange of information among individuals and groups online. Expression also represents a view perspective, reflection, or quality of the individual or groups.  Figure 1: Abstract view of social networking , In 1997, first social site was launched named sixdegree.com. , The intention of this site was to make online dating smoother, and for the first time users were able to create their personal profile and then post it online and even surf the network. After sixdegree.com, other social sites were launched, and served for a while, and failed to become a sustainable business entity. Since then Ryze.com (2002), match.com, were launched and used by many users. Uncontrolled use of microblogging separates the users from the real world life and creates shortage of attention. , Use of social networking site has disadvantages and advantages. , It is up to the interest and knowledge of the user to know how to use them, when and which site to use. , Social networking has some of the advantages like the meeting places but virtually where people can share thoughts with whoever they want and meet them in the first place. Some people used social networking sites to make new friends, establish relationships and even marry. Some of them used this websites, in order to find their lost friends in their life and meet them. Use of social networking makes life faster and easier to get the latest news across the world at any moment and being updated. Nowadays, colleges and universities are getting fond of social networking, which makes it easier for faculty and students to find information freely and easily. Corporate and technical sectors also started recruiting employees with the help of social networking by going through  their profile and background. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:9      , Since social networking sites are operating worldwide; it breaks some of the cultural  , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families barriers around the different parts of the world. , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families easily and without any cost. Social networking brings the world together and modifies communication. Everything in the world has both advantages and disadvantages, even for social networking, the disadvantages are as follows; personal identity theft is the most popular one. , Social networking requires user‟s personal details in order to gain full access to the site as sign up. Recent information and news disclosed that some of the social networking websites misuses the personal information of users. Advertisers evade users‟ privacy. Sex offenders and criminals often visit the sites to find new victims. Some people mostly young ones for the sake of revenge and hate post embarrassing information or photos. These types of crimes can be categorized as cyber bullying in social networking makes this much faster and easier, unfortunately sometimes even led to death of teens. The developers made the social networking sites for better communication but people are rather addicted to those sites. This will hinder the ability of young people to develop real social life, face to face meeting of people, which is very important in developing conversation and speech. The traditional face to face socializing is becoming obsolete.  , Online Microblogging , Online microblogging is broadcast medium that exists similar to blogging.  Microblogging is different from blogging as its content normally smaller in both total and actual file size. , Microblogs allow users to share small chunks of content such as video link, individual images or short messages, which may be the major reason for their popularity.   , Advantages of Microblogging over traditional blogging:- Why would anyone want to start posting on a microblogging site? If you've been hesitant to jump on on a site like Twitter or , Tumblr, here are a few reasons to consider trying them , Developing content takes less time: The traditional blogs are quite lengthy so that it takes time to complete our intent. , Microblogging gives you the benefit of posting the most recently happened incident to aware your loved ones in a short time and message.   Individual parts of the content consumed in less time : Hence, microblogging  is such a popular and interactive form of information consumption and social media on mobile devices, because as the gist of the content to the people increases, therefore it is best way where the news comes in short and precise way as compare to long ones that takes time.  Increases chances of frequent posts: Microblogging involves the more frequent posts and shorter ones whereas traditional blogging involves exactly opposite less frequent post and longer. Since you're saving so much time by focusing on just posting short pieces, you `can afford to post more frequently.  Share time sensitive or urgent information in an easier way: Huge number of microblogging platforms have been made to be fast and easy to use. With a Vine video, Tumblr post, Instagram photo or a simple tweet, you can easily share to everyone on what's happening in your life or any news at this very moment.  Communication with followers becomes easy and direct : In addition to communicate easily with greater short and frequent posts, microblogging platforms can be used  easily to encourage and facilitate better  interaction  through liking, reblogging , tweeting , commenting and more.  Convenient using with mobile and tabs: Microblogging gains too much of attention in present days and the main cause behind this is increasing trends of mobile browsing. It is difficult to consume, interact and write long and lengthy blog post in a tab or smartphone that‟s why microblogging comes into play and provide small, easy and faster posts.  , Twitter , Twitter is an online microblogging service that allows users to read and write short sentences of length 140 characters called tweets. Twitter Inc. is located at San Francisco. Users should register first to post any message, whereas unregistered users can only read them. Users can access Twitter with the website interface, mobile application or SMS. Twitter was created by , Noah Glass, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey in , March 2006 and launched in July 2006. Twitter has 310 Million monthly active users, 1 billion unique visits monthly to sites with embedded tweets, 83% of active users access through mobile application, consists of 3500 employees around the world, more than 35 offices across the world, 79% accounts are from outside the U.S. , supports more than 40 languages and , 40% employees of Twitter are from technical background. All numbers approximate as of March 31, 2016. , The company experienced rapid initial growth. In year 2007 around 4,00,000 tweets were posted per quarter. In 2008 this extends to 10 million tweets a quarter. 50 millions tweets were posted per day in February 2010. 70000 applications were registered by company as March 2010. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:10       Figure 2: Twitter Logo , According to Twitter, 750 tweets are posted each second which equals to each day around 65 million tweets were posted as of , June 2010. On daily basis around 140 tweets were posted by , March 2011. In January 2009, since it gained a lot of popularity, , Twitter becomes third-highest online microblogging site, given by Compete.com. , The reason we are using microblogging and Twitter data are the following:  The scope of microblogging tends to grow bigger and bigger day by day. Easy to use and people can share and give opinions on a certain topic, thus it makes essential source.  Twitter generates vast number of messages that is increasing exponentially. The extracted data can be enormously large.  Twitter users varies from person to person as user can be politicians, film stars, celebrities, sportsmen and many leaders across the country. So, it contains all the messages of different caste, religion and sex.  Twitter users are all over the world so it contains data for different language.  , Sentiment Analysis , Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. Users share the things about their ongoing life, discuss current issues and variety of topics. , Independent to write in any format without following rules that makes this more popular than older blogging sites. Movies and product reviews easily available now a days or thoughts on religious and political issues, so it becomes essential sources of user sentiment and opinion. Data that are we using in our experiment are from Twitter, it contains a vast number of messages by large number of users created by themselves. , Messages can vary from public opinion to personal thought. , These microblogging sites are huge source of information and it is quite easy to say that there is a need for automating the sentiment analysis process as there is too much work involved in processing this information manually. Various approaches are practiced for the automation of this process like machine learning and natural language processing. Users are increasing day by day as the population and trend of using microblogging sites are increasing, so the data can be used in research purpose of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. , In the time of election every news channel show the exit polls of every political party. So, every political party willing to know how many are in favor can do so  with the help of microblogging sites where people will give their opinions about likes and dislikes of theirs party. These opinions will help parties to increase their voters. , The data we are using in this experiment are movie reviews. We have collected about 17000 movie reviews from Twitter. The movie reviews contains categorized in three ways: reviews of different movies. Reviews can be categorized in three ways: , 1. Positive reviews: Messages in which people liked the movie. , 2. Negative reviews: Messages in which people not liked the movie. , 3. Neutral reviews: Messages in which people do not have emotions or based on mere fact. , We have extracted 5000 each positive, negative and neutral reviews for training set and 2000 reviews will be used in test set. , We show comparison between the different machine learning classifiers and empirically conclude which will give the best result among these. , II. RESEARCH PROBLEM Problem Statement , Microblogging is type of blogging which consists of a limited number of words. Limitation of words determined by respective microblogging sites. It gives right to share his/her thoughts, opinions and sentiments in less number of words. It is one of the revolutionary things happening in the world of technology. , People these days depend upon microblogging sites such as , Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. to communicate with both relatives and rest of world. Here sentiments come into the play which will be shared by anyone in the time they feel and wanted it to be shared. Sentiments are nothing but feelings with respect to event or situation. Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. , The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present day is a prominent issue in the field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on social networking websites, a huge amount of data produced in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral.  , Gap Analysis , A lot of research has been done in the area of sentiment analysis. , Many researchers used Part-Of-Speech and polarity based feature using supervised learning techniques for classifying. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:11      , Many automatic classifiers are proposed for classifying the texts in the given expressions but with the restricted domains, but there will be new informal words that are added to the present world which means something in the common social network, so there is a need to include all the common referred terms that are used in the social networking world.  , Objectives , The objectives of the paper has been discussed in the following points :- , 1. To explore, analyze and study the existing sentiment analysis detection techniques in the online microblogging network. , 2. To study how the tweets can be generated from the Twitter with the help of Java API. , 3. To implement and analyze the results achieved after applying the supervised , 4. Learning classifiers to the dataset.  , III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The main aim of this paper is to compare the results that are implemented with the help of supervised classifier. , The paper follows the following methodology : , 1. We have collected a corpus of positive, negative and neutral tweets with the help of Twitter4j java API from , Twitter. The size of our corpus is large. , 2. We then remove the stop words from the collected corpus to make the content free from commas, full stops etc. , 3. Lastly, we  apply machine learning algorithms to our training set first and then test set and compare the results. , With the help of results we evaluate which machine learning algorithm is best for classification of data.  , Preprocessing , Collection of data: We collected data from Twitter API named as Twitter4j using netbeans. given by using Hashtag(#) followed by the movie name like #FAN, #BajarangiBhaijaan, #TheJungleBook etc. Approx 17000 tweets have been collected from the various movie tweets. , Reviews can also be searched by #Hash tags followed by respective movie stars, directors, production‟s house and music record companies. In Twitter, hash tags become the necessary symbol to find about something and it gives user limit of 140 words to express their views and attitude.  , Normalization , We have found that to get desired results from the classifier we have to make sure that  the tweets can be processed properly. As tweets can be in user language, so we have to clean the data which is irrelevant to the classification. The things which can be irrelevant are as follows :-  URL: URLs in the message will not make any sense as it simply distracts the result of classifier.  Username: Removal of username can be necessary for cleaning purposes as it can effect falsely to our results.  Repeated characters: If the character is repeated more than two times then it can  comprise new word but the meaning is the same, so we have to eliminate that word and make the word genuine. For example „good‟ can be written as „gooooood‟.  , Repeated words If the message contains word which has appeared more than two times continuously then it has to be changed into two times. For example, „great great great great movie‟ can be converted to „great great movie‟.  , Removal of stop words , Stop words are words like “a”, ”is”, ”the”, “etc” etc; These words have nothing to do with the emotion , so has to be discarded from the message. Now, the next step is to train the data using supervised classifier.  , Machine Learning Techniques , We employed classification methods which is polarity based using set of positive, negative and neutral tweets provided by , Twitter4j API. Polarity is given by ratio of probability of a word appeared in set of positive or negative statement which makes the word positive or negative. The classifiers we are using are based on the concept of polarity. , If the feature is independent and based only on Standard English , ...]</td>\n",

However, currently availab le algorithms focus basically on the recognition of modern coins. To date, no optical recognition system fo r coins has been researched successfully. In this paper, an algorithm based on unequally spaced frequency Fourier transforms is proposed for the recognition of coins. The performance of proposed algorithm is measured in terms of mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio.  Keywords : Coin, Feature Extraction, Neural Network, Recognition, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)  , I.   INTRODUCTION  , Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our life. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines etc. In-spite of daily uses, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purpose by the organizations that deal with the ancient coins. The three main coin recognition systems are mechanical method based systems, electromagnetic method based systems and image processing based systems   [4]   [5].   , The   mechanical   method   based systems use parameters like diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of the coin to differentiate between the coins. But these parameters cannot be used to differentiate between the different materials of the coins i.e. if we provide two coins original and the fake having same diameter, thickness, weight and  magnetism but  with  different  materials then  such system will not be able to differentiate the original co in. The electromagnetic method based systems can differentiate between different materials because in these systems the coins are passed through an oscillating coil at a certain frequency and different materials bring d ifferent changes in the amplitude and direction of frequency. So these changes and the other parameters   like   diameter,   thickness,   weight   and magnetis m can be used to differentiate between coins. The electromagnetic based coin recognition systems improve the accuracy of recognition but still they can be fooled by some game co ins. In the recent years coin recognition systems based on images have also come into picture [8]. In these systems, first of all the image of the coin to be recognized is taken  either by camera or by some scanning. Then these images are processed by various image processing techniques like FFT, , DCT, edge detection, segmentation etc. and further various features are extracted from the images which are used to recognize different coins.  , II.        LITERATURE S URVEY  , An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) bas e d Automated Coin  , Recognition System [2] is proposed for the recognition of , Indian Coins of denomination `1, `2, `5 and `10 with rotation invariance. Since the images are  taken from  both  sides  of  coin,  so  this system  is  capable  of  recognizing  coins  from  both sides.  Features a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  i m a g e s  u s i n g  techniques    of    Hough    Transformat ion,    Pattern  , Averaging etc.  and then  the  extracted  features  are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. An algorithm for recognit ion of the co ins of d ifferent denomination is presented [3]. The proposed system first uses a canny edge detection to generate an edge map and then uses CHT (Circu lar Hough transform) to recognize the coins and further find the radii of them. In [1], authors presented an approach based on image subtraction technique for recognition of , Indian Coins. In [7], authors presented the coin identification approach in which images of coin are taken from different angles and a databank is created. By using this databank, data is providing to the neural network fo r its training. An image based approach for coin recognition using gabor wavelet for feature extract ion is provided [6].  , III.PROPOS ED COIN RECOGNITION S YSTEM  , The fo llowing  steps are performed  in  the proposed coin recognition system:  , Step 1:   Develop a RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLA B. , Step 2: The Pre-processing of a coin image is perfo rmed for recognizing the type of coin. , Step 3: Unequally spaced frequency Fourier transform is applied. , Step  4: The  training  &amp;  testing  phase  of  neural network  with  rotation  invariance  is  applied  during coin recognition. , Step 5:  The results are displayed in the form of MSE and , PSNR , In this section we present recent approaches for coin recognition techniques, namely algorithms based on the , Eigen space approach, gradient features, contour and texture features. Finally, we discuss some preliminary   results   of   tests   performed   on   the muscle cis coin dataset.  , Research Article                                                                                                                              Volume 7 Issue No.4    , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10310                                                                 http://ijesc.org/    , 3.1 Coin detection , Hough transform is based on feature points extracted from the original image and usually, edges are used as the feature points. Various edge detection methods have been used for different applications. If Sobel filter is used to a coin image, large number of edge points are obtained from texture of the coin can be regarded as noise, which will induce a huge overhead   in   the   execution   time   of   the   Hough transform and most importantly will produce measurement errors, so technique to reduce the unwanted edge is sought. , Fig. 2 shows the result of applying Sobel filters to given input image (Fig. 1). The canny edge detector is very powerful tool for detecting edges in a noisy environment. Canny edge detector can remove most of the edge points. Canny gives thin edge as compared to the Sobel. Hence, canny edge detector has used for eliminating the unwanted edges that can result from , Sobel. Based on the smoothed image, derivatives in both the x and y direction are computed, these in turn are used to compute the gradient magnitude of the image.  Once the gradient magnitude of the image has been c o m p u t e d , a  p r o c e s s  c a l l e d  n o n  m a x i m u m  suppression is performed; in which pixels are suppressed if they do not constitute a local maximum.   Figure.1. Sample Coin image   Figure.2. Result of Sobel Filter   Figure.3. Result of Canny Edge Detection.  , The final step in the canny edge detector is to use hysteresis operator, in which p ixels are marked as edges, non edges and in-between based on threshold values. The next step is to consider each of the pixels that are in-between, if they are connected to edge pixels these are marked as edge pixels as well. The result of this edge detector is a binary image in which the white pixels closely approximate the true edges of the original image as shown in , Fig. 3.  , 3.2Coin verification , In general the appearance of one coin pattern varies considerably with respect to its grey values. These variations frequently are inhomogeneous and this suggests  that  fo r recognit ion  purposes, grey values by themselves will not give us appropriate results. On the other hand, edge information  remains more or less stable or at least degrades gracefully. So  the proposed research work is based on the detection on  edges.  In princip le any edge detector may be used for this purpose but Canny edge operator and the Laplacian of , Gaussian method provides more satisfactory results. As a result of the edge operator we either get a binary (edge) image or a list of coord inates at edge pixel locations.  , Let I : M× N → R[0,1] be an intensity image. M× N gives the  index space and  R[0,1] are  the  intensity values taken from the closed interval [0, 1]. E(x, y) ={ 1, if I(x, y) is an edge point , 0, els e   , 3.3 Coin recognition , Neural networks  give effect ive  resu lts fo r solving mult iple  class classification problems. Neural network has three types of layers: input layer, output layers and hidden layers. Hidden layer does intermediate computation before direct ing the input to output layer. Back propagation can also be considered as a generalization of delta rule. When back propagation network is cycled, an input pattern is propagated forward to the output units through the intervening input to hidden and hidden to output weights. Neural network have been widely used in image and signal processing. In our proposed work, neural network with rotation invariance is applied during coin recognition.  , IV .RES ULTS &amp;DISCUSS ION  , 4.1 Performance metrics , MSE and PSNR are the two error metrics used to compare image quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the compressed and the original image, whereas , PSNR represents a measure of the peak error and these can be computed as:   In above equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images, respectively. PSNR can be calculated as: In   the   previous   equation,   R   is   the   maximum fluctuation in the input image e.g. if the input image has a double-precision floating data type, then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255.    , 4.2 Experimental results  , Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of the outcomes of the proposed coin recognition system used for identifying the coin by using the neural networks.   , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10311                                                                 http://ijesc.org/   Figure.4.

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  , Index Terms—Computer vision, Edge detection, Image processing, Pixel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , Date of Submission: 10-10-2020                                                                           Date of Acceptance: 26-10-2020 , ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  , I. Introduction The edge detection methods has a significant role in image processing work. By using image processing, we can use computational power for variety of applications [6]. We can use edge detection techniques in different fields of industry and agriculture [16]. The purpose of edge detection is to point out the differences and to identify the physical occurrence which produces them. Image edge information contains a lot of information [4]. Edge detection must be convenient because the validity, competence, and probability of the completion of successive processing phase depends on it. The segregation of the image into the background and object is a critical step in the image interpretation. Edges are the boundary between different textures. Edge is the discontinuities in the image intensity from one pixel to another. Detection of the edges for an image may help for data compression, data segmentation, and image reconstruction [2]. Edge detection is difficult in the noisy image since both the noise and edge contain high-frequency contents. Attempt to reduce the noise results makes the image more noisy and result in distorted image. Filters are used in the process of identifying the images by pointing and locating the discontinuities which brings the changes into pixel intensity are the boundary of an image. We always need a good edges for higher level processing.  An accurate and fast edge detector can upgrade the performance for complete processing system [19]. There are a lot of edge detection techniques available and each designed with a certain type of features. Since basic of image processing for object detection is edge detection, it is pivotal to have a good grasp of the edges detection techniques. In the fig. 1, the gradient vector of an edge pixel is shown. The intensity for each pixel changes from 0 to 255 in the gradient direction. strength of the edge is indicated by the magnitude of the gradient. An edge pixel is identified by using two traits, the edge strength which is the magnitude of the gradient, and the edge direction which is the angle of the gradient. [9].   , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              7 | Page  Fig. 1 The gradient of pixel of an image  , The characteristic direction is determined by the geometry of the operator which is most sensitive to edges. Operators can be easily optimized to look for diagonal, vertical, or horizontal edges. There are many ways to perform edge detection, but the majority of the techniques can be classified into two groups: · Gradient-based edge detection: The gradient method finds edge by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. · Laplacian based edge detection: The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image [14-17]. An edge has the shape of a ramp which is one-dimensional and location can be easily highlighted by calculating the derivative of the image [11]. Assume we have the following signal, with an edge shown by the jump in intensity below:   Fig.2 Intensity jump  , If we consider the gradient of this signal (which, in one dimension, is just the first derivative concerning for to t) we get the following:     Fig.3 First derivative  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              8 | Page , II. Methodology 1. There are a lot of problems due to false edge detection, missing true edges, in edge detection techniques production of thick or thin lines are problems due to noise.  The visual comparison is analyzed in this paper which is the most  used Laplacian and Gradient-based Edge Detection techniques for problems of faulty edge detection, missing real edges, problems due to noise, and producing thick or thin lines, etc. In this paper, different edge detection algorithms are compared to find an efficient and superior edge detection algorithm. , Different edge detection method , 2.  , 2.1 Sobel operator Sobel edge detection is considered a traditional method used in image processing techniques. The Sobel kernels are suitable to detect edges along the vertical and horizontal axis. The Sobel operator is based on convolving the image with a separable, small, and integer-valued filter [13]. The Sobel uses two pairs of 3x3 kernels for x and y-direction.                                         , -1  0  +1  , -2  0  +2  , -1  0  +1  +1  +2  +1  , 0  0  0  , -1  -2  -1      , Table.1 x-direction   Table.2 y-direction the kernel is rotated by 90°.  This method is used to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction of each image pixel. The magnitude of the vector is given as:     ∆f = mag(∆f) = [Gx, 2+GY, 2]½………………….(1)  , 1.2 Prewitt edge detection , Prewitt edge method matches with Sobel edge method. Prewitt edge detection masks are one of the old and well-understood methods of detecting edges in images. It is widely used for detecting horizontal and vertical edges and gives those points where there is maximum gradient [12]. The strength of the edge at the given point is then the square root of the sum of the squares of two derivatives. , 1.3 Canny edge detector , Canny edge detection detects a wide range of edges in image. It is a multi-step algorithm which can detect edges with noise suppressed at the time [5]. It was proposed to buy Canny in 1986. the initial level, it applies a , Gaussian filter that smooths the image to wipe out the noise. The main problem with this type of edge detection approach is a high threshold misses important edges and a low threshold produces false. , 1.4 Robert edge detection , This operator executes a gradient detection using the difference between adjacent pixels in the diagonal direction [3]. In Robert edge detection, the horizontal and vertical edges are calculated individually and then put together for resulting edge detection [18]. It approximates the gradient intensity in discrete differentiation, which is obtained by the summation of squares of differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. The Roberts edge detector computes 2-D spatial gradient on the image [8]. It uses a pair of 2x2 convoluted kernels, which is like a , Sobel edge method. Roberts x, y kernels is mentioned below:                                                                                                                                                 Table.3 Gx                    Table.4 Gy   1.5 Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) , This method of edge detection was invented in 1980 by Marr and Hildreth. In this method, the Laplacian is combined with Gaussian filtering change the image where the intensity varies to detect the edges effectively. It finds the actual place of edges and testing large area around the pixels. The disadvantage of the LOG operator is that it cannot find out the orientation of edge because of the Laplacian filter. The use of gaussian operator in , LOG  formulation is to smooth the image and  use the zero crossing to the location of edges [7].   All of these techniques can be grouped into three modules      • Gradient (estimate of the 1stderivative)        • Laplacian (Zero crossing detectors) derivative)         • Image approximation algorithm +1  0    0  1  , 0  +1    -1  0  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              9 | Page                 , Table.5  , 3. Mathematical morphological operators In a morphological operation, each and every pixel in the image is compared based on the value of other pixels in its area of neighbourhood [1]. A structuring element is a special filtering tool that enhances an input image. It can be of different sizes and different shapes. In mathematical morphology, a gradient image can be considered as a topological surface where the numerical value of each pixel indicates the evaluation of their points [10]. , These are Some of the main mathematical morphological operators: , 2.1 Dilation , It is the highest value in the window. The image after dilation becomes brighter or the intensity increases because of the maximum value in the window. It expands the image and is mainly used to fill the gap. Dilation process expands image objects by changing pixels with a value of “1” from“0”. , 2.2 Erosion , It is not at all similar to dilation. It is the lowest value in the window. The image after Erosion will be darker than the original image. It shrinks or thins the image. This process shrinking objects or images by changing pixels with a value of “1” to “0”. , 2.3 Opening and closing , Both opening and closing parameters are formed by using erosion and dilation. In the opening, firstly image will be eroded and then it will be followed by dilation. And in case of closing, firstly image will be dilated and then followed by erosion. , A. Mean Squared Error , The average of the squares of the \"errors\" is measured by the mean squared error of an estimator i.e. the difference between what is estimated and estimator. The contrast happens due to randomness or as a result of the estimator doesn’t calculate information that could result in a better accurate estimate. The PSNR differ inversely with the MSE. , The mean square error is the squared error averaged over the M × N array.  , MSE=1/MN ∑ ∑ (f1(m,n)- f2(m,n))2 ………………….(1)     Where f1 (m, n) and  f2 (m, n) are the output and input images respectively and M, N are the dimensions of the image. Its value must be less. , RMSE=√MSE , B. Peak signal to noise ratio , Peak signal to noise ratio is the ratio between the power of corrupting noise and the most significant possible power of a signal. It is represented by PSNR. Here, PSNR refers to the ratio between the edge detected images i.e. the estimator output and the ground truth image which is also referred to be the estimated image. It is the logarithmic function of the peak value of the image and the mean square error. Usually, PSNR is expressed in decibel scale. PSNR can be rated by the following Equation 2: , PSNR=10 LOG(2552/MSE) ………………….(2) , Where MSE is mean square error. Its value must be high.  , Original images are shown below and algorithms are applied to it.

This is obtained by the experimental analysis of , Canny edge detection operator of image2.  , 6. Comparison of Techniques          , Table.6  , For image 1 we have calculated MSE and PSNR for different methods of different edge detection techniques. In the experimental analysis, we came across to analyze that canny operators have been the most efficient and effective method for the detection of edges. Different edge detectors works better under the different cases and conditions, there cannot be any algorithm that make use of multiple edge detectors [15].           , Table.7  , Similarly, we have to calculate the same for image 2. Under this experimental analysis, we find the same that the canny operator for this method has worked out well in all aspects. , We obtained different images for different edge detection techniques. All of them are different in some aspects and the most efficient method is the canny edge detection technique in both cases. All other methods have some blur and noisy labels that affect the efficiency of the image as compared to the canny edge detection techniques.     , 7.  , ...]</td>\n",

Removal of background noise is one of the crucial task because the speech signal should not be harmed by noise signal. Typically many speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed by concentrating only on short-time magnitude spectrum or else by compensating the phase spectrum by keeping the magnitude spectrum unchanged. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique by changing both magnitude and phase spectra  to improve the quality of a speech signal by producing an modified complex spectrum. In simulation results, both objective speech quality measure PESQ and spectrogram analysis has shown the performance of an enhanced speech signal.  Keywords - speech enhancement, magnitude spectrum, phase spectrum compensation. , 1. INTRODUCTION , Speech enhancement is nothing but noise suppression technology. It perceives most  important significance to improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signal in the noise environments. Natural background noises are sounds better when compared to unwanted twisted noises such as  traffic sounds, music sounds, some other person is speaking in the background etc, which may degrades the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the desired speech signal.  , Enhancement of speech signal is based on magnitude and phase spectrum compensation to restore the original signal from several background noises. , Let the noisy speech be defined as \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 1  where  represents discrete-time signals of noisy speech,  represents original speech  represents noise component. , The discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a set of real and complex numbers of  to produce a periodic function of frequency variable. Therefore, the DSTFT of the corrupted speech signal is defined as , ⁄ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2  where  defines as the kth discrete frequency of uniformly spaced  frequencies and  is an analysis window function. Therefore by using DSTF transform Eq.(1) can be represented as , , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 3  where , , ,  and ,  represents DSTF transform’s of the total noise speech,  clean speech, and noise, respectively. The above equation is determined to describe each part of the speech signal in terms of the DSTFT magnitude spectrum and the DSTFT phase spectrum. Here, the clean speech signal ,  can be represented in terms of polar form as , | , | , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4  where | , | is the magnitude spectrum, and ∠ ,  is the phase spectrum. , Many of the existing speech enhancement algorithms to remove the noisy speech as well as to look at the effects of intelligibility of speech signal to improve the quality of the speech signal. Actually, the speech signal is converted into polar form to generate magnitude and phase spectrum of the speech signal with respect to frequency. Here, many of the speech models has been proposed for speech enhancement, which is based only on the statistical model of magnitude to produce a modified complex spectrum. Thus, the modified complex spectrum is known as the estimated clean speech spectrum. , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 112, The following are some of the existing speech enhancement algorithm which is used to change only the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech signal and then combines with the unchanged phase spectrum to form a modified complex spectrum. Boll proposed Spectral subtraction (SSUB) in 1979. The basic idea of this method is that the noisy speech signal is the combination of both clean speech and noise as shown in Eqn.(1). Now, the magnitude spectrum of noise is get subtracted by the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech. Therefore, the resultant magnitude spectrum of clean speech is combines with the unchanged phase spectrum[2] to obtain modified complex spectrum. Wiener filter[4]was proposed by Wiener. Hansen and Jensen. The basic principle of the weiner filter is to obtain an estimate of clean signal from the signal corrupted by the noise component. The estimate clean speech is obtained by minimizing the mean square error(MSE) between the desired signal  and the estimated signal ̂ . The MMSE estimator[3], which is presented by Ephraim and Malah in 1984. The MMSE method is analyzed by using short time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator to enhance the desired speech signal quality. This method is also based on statistical analysis. Doclo and Moonen further extended the Wiener method in the mutil-channel case [6]. Ephraim and Van Trees proposed the linear predictive factors to estimate the pure speech signal[7]. , Conventional speech enhancement method enhances the magnitude spectrum and usue the corrupted speech phase spectrum for signal recovery. Mainly, all the existing are used to change the magnitude spectrum of the speech signal because the phase spectrum provides less perceptual effect at high signal to noise ratio(SNR) level[8].Later, it has been found that phase spectrum is also helpful for  speech enhancement applications[9]. , This paper proposed a novel method by focusing on both components such as magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a speech signal to improve the quality and intelligibility of a speech signal. The quality of the sppech signal is measured by PESQ (Perceptual Estimation of Speech Quality) score compared with conventional methods. , 2. LITERATURE REVIEW i. Spectral subtractive algorithms: , In AMS (analysis–modification–synthesis) framework, the modulation domain processing was added by Paliwaland Schwerin[10]. To know the importance of the modulation stage for speech intelligibility, they had done three experiments, they are , 1. Investigate the relative contributions to intelligibility of the modulation magnitude , 2. Modulation phase, and  , 3. Acoustic phase spectra.   , In these 3 experiments they found that that the intelligibility of stimuli constructed from only y the modulation magnitude or phase spectra is significantly lower than the intelligibility of the acoustic magnitude spectrum. So here we can recognize that there is an effect of the modulation frame duration on intelligibility for both, the modulation magnitude and phase spectrum as the speech reconstructed from only the short-time modulation phase spectrum has highest intelligibility when long modulation frame durations (&gt;256 ms) are used. ii. Statistical-model-based algorithms , The effects of window shape and its length on the quality of phase-only and also magnitude-only reconstructed speech was investigated by Loveimi, Ahadi (Loveimi, Ahadi, 2010)[11]. The Speech signal is reconstructed through Least Square Error Estimation (LSEE) and Overlap Add (OLA) methods from its magnitude-only and phase-only spectra. If we want to reconstruct the speech from its magnitude spectrum they select sequence of random uniformly distributed numbers in the range of (−  , , ), as the phase sequence, or substitute phase spectrum with zero. iii. Subspace algorithms , The Combined TSP method gives a relatively better performance compared to temporal or spectral processing alone was invented by Krishnamoorthy &amp;  Prasanna[11]. They propose a noisy speech enhancement method by combining linear prediction (LP) residual weighting in the time domain and spectral processing in the frequency domain is used  to provide better noise suppression as well as better enhancement in the speech regions. By estimating the sum of the peaks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum, the gross level features are computed. Using the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation the fine level features are identified. This system is performed only on the high SNR regions of the spectrally processed speech. , 3. PROPOSED METHOD , In our proposed method a noisy speech signal is transformed into magnitude and phase spectrum to produce a modified complex spectrum to obtain better intelligibility and high speech quality. , The magnitude spectrum of clean speech is defined as  √2 2 1 2, 2 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 5  where ∙  and ∙  represents the modified Bessel functions of zero and first order, respectively.  can be defined as  , 1 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 6  , Implementation of Magnitude and Phase Spectrum Compensation to Achieve an Enhanced Speech Signal 113   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 where  and  can de defined as  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 7              , Fig. 1.

Zero weighting is applied to the values of  non conjugate vectors of DSTF transform (i.e,\\t 0 and 2⁄  for ).The next step is to generate a phase spectrum compensation to reduce the noise of the speech signal and to generate a complex spectrum. , , Λ , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 10  Now the phase spectrum compensation function is obtained by ∠ , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 11  ARG=complex angle function , The above equation is giving the information about magnitude estimation and compensated phase spectrum.

The output of this may be complex because it is in time representation. So in PSC method the imaginary part is removed. And the final result, i.e enhanced time domain signal is obtained by applying overlap-Add method procedure, ̂ . 4. DISCUSSION , 1. A clean speech is corrupted by the noise at the receiver section.

Many of the previous methods are used to operate only on short timemagnitude spectrum by keeping short time phase spectrum to enhance the quality of the speech signal. , 3.

The proposed system aims to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks. The proposed system is tested on real time recognition from a web camera and on the publicly available dataset. , The experimental results, which were obtained on publicly available data sets of fingerprint and 2D face, show tha t the proposed method is highly competitive compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and the analysis of the general image quality of real biometric samples reveals highly valuable information which may be very efficiently used to discriminate them from fake traits.  , Index Terms- Attacks, biometrics, countermeasures, image quality assessment, security.   , I. INTRODUCTION  , The  interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security has been increasing day by day that  leads to the creation of numerous and very diverse initiatives that focused on this  field of research[1] that includes the publication of many research works disclosing and evaluating different biometric vulnerabilities[2], [3], the proposal of new protection methods[4, 5, 6],  related book chapters[7] the publication of several standards in the area, the dedication of specific track sessions and workshops in biometric-specific and general signal processing conferences[8, 19],and the organization of competitions that focused on vulnerability assessment, the acquisition of specific datasets, the creation of groups and the laboratories specialized in the evaluation of biometric security, or there may be the existence of several European , Projects with the biometric security topic as main research interest.  , The above all these initiatives clearly highlight the importance given by all parties that involved in the development of biometrics  to the improvement of the systems security that brings  rapidly emerging technology into practical use. The speed and very low complexity of the proposed technique is an added advantage that makes it very well suited to operate on real scenarios (one of the desired characteristics of this type of methods). As we know that it does not deploy  any trait-specific property (e.g., minutiae points or face detection), the computation load needed for image processing purposes is very reduced and by   using only general image quality measures fast to compute and combined with very simple classifiers. , The system has been tested on publicly available attack databases of fingerprint and 2D face and also on real time. The proposed system has reached results fully comparable to those obtained on the same databases and here we follow the same experimental protocols by more complex trait-specific top-ranked approaches from the state-of-the-art.  , II. LITERATURE SURVEY  , In the entitled Paper Javier (Galbally Z.Wei, 2014), introduced a novel software-based multi-biometric and multi-attack protection method that targets to overcome part of limitations through the use of image quality assessment (IQA). It is not capable of operating with a very good performance under different biometric systems and also for diverse spoofing scenarios. In the paper (Poonam Dabas , Z.Wei, 2013), introduced objective methods for measuring the quality of images. In this paper, the proposed method focused on the various quality measures and an algorithm to model HVS (Human , Visual System). The properties of HVS are perceived brightness and frequency response and HVS is used to process input images. , The Approach of this paper [9] is based on the fact that hiding information in digital media requires alterations of the signal properties that introduce some form of degradation. The addition of a watermark or message leaves unique artifacts that can be detected using Image Quality Measures (IQM) is shown in this paper. The paper proves that image quality assessment can be used to discriminate between cover images and , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 50 stego-images. The paper also proves that the hypothesis that message-embedding scheme leave statistical evidence or structure in images that can be exploited for detection. In this paper [9], a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications is proposed. The index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors:  , A. Loss of Correlation Here, the degree of linear correlation between x and y is measured. Its dynamic range [-1, 1].  , B. Luminance Distortion   It will measure how close the mean luminance is between x and y. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1].  , C. Contrast Distortion It will measure how much similar are the contrasts are. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1]. The paper proves that the index outperforms the traditional method of error calculation of images for quality.  , III. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR , LIVENESS DETECTION  , In this paper, we have assumption that: “It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed.” Here, expected quality differences between real and fake samples may include: degree of sharpness, color and luminance levels, local artifacts, amount of information found in both type of images (entropy), structural distortions or natural appearance like face images captured from a mobile device will probably be over- or under-exposed; and fingerprint images captured from a gummy finger present local acquisition artifacts such as spots and patches. By following this “quality-difference” hypothesis, in the present research work we explore the potential of general image quality assessment as a protection method against different biometric attacks. Since the implemented features do not evaluate any specific property of a given biometric modality or of a specific attack so they may be computed on any image and the proposed method gives a new multi-biometric dimension. In the proposed state-of-the-art, the reasons behind the use of IQA features for liveness detection is supported by three factors:  , 1. The previous works for image manipulation detection [11, 12], and steg analysis [13, 14] in the forensic field has successfully used image quality. To an extent, various spoofing attacks like  those which involve taking a picture of a facial image displayed in a 2D device (e.g., spoofing attacks with printed face images), may be regarded as a type of image manipulation which can be effectively detected, as shown in the proposed  research work, by the use of different quality features. , 2. The previous studies in the forensic area and different features measuring trait-specific quality properties have already been used for liveness detection purposes in fingerprint  applications [5].This work gives a solid basis to the use of image quality as a protection method in biometric systems. , 3. As human observers very often refer to the “different appearance” of real and fake samples to distinguish between them. So, different metrics and methods designed for IQA intend to estimate in an objective and reliable way the perceived appearance of images by humans. In the proposed system, we have used different quality measures to differentiate between real and fake images.  , IV. PROPOSED METHOD  , In this proposed method, we present a novel fake detection model which can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, using image quality assessment. In the designed system, for real time recognition, we are interfacing camera to Raspberry pi and the camera will capture face image of a person and send to controller. Face and iris of the person from the image will be recognized by the controller and the finger print module will take the finger print from the person and send to controller. Then after controller will recognize the finger print of person from the data base and if they are matched then it will display the data on display unit.   Fig.1 Architecture diagram for real time recognition from a   web camera  , A.  Proposed algorithm for real time recognition In real time recognition, at first we have collected at least 15 images from webcam and then after we have trained the collected images by using Linear , Discriminant Analysis and finally we have tested the image of the same person (again image is taken from webcam).We have grabbed fingerprint of the person , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 51 from fingerprint scanner. Step wise description is given below.  , 1) Proposed Face Recognition The process of putting a label to a known face is known as face recognition. The proposed algorithm includes the following four steps:  , I. Face Detection , II. Face preprocessing , III. Training real time faces using Linear , Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , IV. Face Recognition  , Face Detection , The process of locating a face region in an image is face detection. In the proposed system, we have used , Haar-based cascade classifier for face detection. This algorithm works for frontal faces, side-view faces, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  , Haar based cascade classifier: , It is an effective face detection method. At first, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) [15, , 19] to train the classifier. After that, we need to extract features from it. Following are the Haar features:   Fig.2.Haar features  , The above features are just like our convolutional kernel and each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. Then all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features. We need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles for each feature calculation. Integral images are introduced to solve this and it simplifies the calculation and among all calculated features, most of them are irrelevant. So we will get over 160000 features and among them, we have to select the best feature and to obtain the best feature, we apply each and every feature on all the training images. It finds the best threshold which will classify the faces to positive and negative for each feature. The concept of this classifier is that instead of using all features on a window, group the features into different stages of classifiers and apply one-by-one. , Haar based cascade classifier using openCV: , In openCV, XML files [15] are stored and contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. , There are many cascade classifier in openCV like face detector, eye detector, mouth detector, etc.  , Steps for Face Detection:  , Loading Haar detector: , Here, pre trained XML file is loaded to perform face detection.  a. Accessing the webcam , Here, we access the webcam from the computer to grab the image.  b. Detecting a face using the Haar Classifier , Before detecting face in camera frame, we should perform the following steps:  i. Grayscale color conversion , As face detection only works on grayscale images. , Therefore, we should convert the color camera frame to grayscale.  ii. Shrinking the camera image , The size of the input image determines the speed of face detection i.e. it is very slow for large images but it is very fast for small images and detection is fairly even for low resolution. Thus, we should shrink the camera image to a more reasonable size.   iii. Histogram equalization , We should perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast and brightness because face detection is not as reliable in low-light conditions. , After performing these above preprocessing steps, we can now detect the face.  iv) Face pre-processing , As face recognition is extremely vulnerable to changes in lighting conditions, face orientation, face expression, thus, it is very important to reduce these differences as much as possible. In the proposed system, we have used histogram equalization for face preprocessing. For our convenience, the proposed system only uses eye detection and we ignore other facial features like mouth, nose etc.  v) Eye detection , It is a very useful for face preprocessing, because for frontal faces we can always assume a person's eyes should be horizontal and on opposite locations of the face and should have a fairly standard position and size within a face, although there are changes in facial , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 52 expressions, lighting conditions, camera properties, distance to camera, and so on. We have used pre-trained XML files for eye detection. vi) Eye search regions , The proposed system shows both left and right eyes region with small rectangle when the system captures the image. After this step, we perform the following steps:  a) Geometrical transformation and cropping: It includes scaling, rotating, and translating the images so that the eyes are aligned and then followed by the removal of the forehead, chin, ears, and background from the face image.  b) Separate histogram equalization for left and right sides: This step standardizes the brightness and contrast on both the left- and right-hand sides of the face independently.  c) Smoothing: Here, the image noise using a bilateral filter is reduced.  d) Elliptical mask: Here, the elliptical mask removes some remaining hair and background from the face image.  vii) Training real time faces using LDA , We can easily collect the face from the camera. This step includes training phase and testing phase.  , Training phase: , Distinguishing between the faces from different people is training phase and collecting the faces from the camera is training set. After collecting faces from the camera, we should train the faces. , The proposed system is trained by using LDA.  , Linear Discriminant Analysis: , LDA is a powerful statistical face recognition technique that overcomes the limitation of Principle component analysis technique by applying the linear discriminant criterion [16].The criterion tries to maximize the ratio of the determinant of the between-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant of the within class scatter matrix of the projected samples. It helps to group images of the same class and separates images of different classes of the images. It is based on 1D eigenvector matrices that appear somewhat like faces when viewed as 2D images [12]. Its basic principle is that it calculates one special eigenvector and eigenvalue for each person. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to access internal data structures of LDA. These data structures are used for mathematical calculations. , These data structures are usually stored as floating-point numbers typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.They are often either a 1D row or column matrix.   viii) Face Recognition , In this step, we find that who a person is just from a facial image. Here we have used Fisher face algorithm for face recognition. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to recognize the faces. In openCV, there are many FaceRecognizer algorithms. , In our system, we have used Fisher face algorithm. , Face verification can be done to confirm if the result of the prediction is reliable or whether it should be taken as an unknown person.  , The facial verification can be done by reconstruction of facial images followed by calculating similarity between reconstructed images and input images. We use openCv functions to perform above steps. Thus, we have used fisher faces algorithm, it needs higher threshold so here we have used threshold, say 0.7.  , 2) Proposed Fingerprint recognition method Fingerprint is another biometric check to the system. , In the proposed system, we have used openCV for fingerprint. Here, we grab the fingerprint [18] of the person at registration time and then we verify the fingerprint at verification time in real time verification.  , Binarization:  , It is the process of converting a pixel image into binary image. At first, we grab the image from the fingerprint scanner and apply binarization. It enables us to remove any desired noise from the image and help us to make the contrast better between the kin and the wrinkled surface of the finger. In the proposed system, we have two phases: Register phase and another is verify phase.  , During register phase, fingerprint is grabbed from fingerprint scanner and features points are stored in the buffer in hexadecimal form. Now during verify phase, again the fingerprint is taken from fingerprint scanner and here also the feature points are stored in buffer in hexadecimal form. If the previous feature point values match with the current feature point then authentication is success otherwise authentication is failed.

PROPSED ALGORITHM FOR OFFLINE , DATASET  , In offline recognition, we have used publicly available dataset for both face and finger which is explained below.  , 1. Proposed Face Recognition: The proposed system includes mainly following three steps in face recognition: i)In first step, we have to find a good database of faces with multiple images for each individual. ii) The second step is to detect faces in the database images and use them to train the face recognizer. iii) The third step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.   , Dataset: , ...]</td>\n",

Users are increasing day by day as the population and trend of using microblogging sites are increasing, so the data can be used in research purpose of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. , In the time of election every news channel show the exit polls of every political party. So, every political party willing to know how many are in favor can do so  with the help of microblogging sites where people will give their opinions about likes and dislikes of theirs party. These opinions will help parties to increase their voters. , The data we are using in this experiment are movie reviews. We have collected about 17000 movie reviews from Twitter. The movie reviews contains categorized in three ways: reviews of different movies. Reviews can be categorized in three ways: , 1. Positive reviews: Messages in which people liked the movie. , 2. Negative reviews: Messages in which people not liked the movie. , 3. Neutral reviews: Messages in which people do not have emotions or based on mere fact. , We have extracted 5000 each positive, negative and neutral reviews for training set and 2000 reviews will be used in test set. , We show comparison between the different machine learning classifiers and empirically conclude which will give the best result among these. , II. RESEARCH PROBLEM Problem Statement , Microblogging is type of blogging which consists of a limited number of words. Limitation of words determined by respective microblogging sites. It gives right to share his/her thoughts, opinions and sentiments in less number of words. It is one of the revolutionary things happening in the world of technology. , People these days depend upon microblogging sites such as , Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. to communicate with both relatives and rest of world. Here sentiments come into the play which will be shared by anyone in the time they feel and wanted it to be shared. Sentiments are nothing but feelings with respect to event or situation. Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. , The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present day is a prominent issue in the field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on social networking websites, a huge amount of data produced in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral.  , Gap Analysis , A lot of research has been done in the area of sentiment analysis. , Many researchers used Part-Of-Speech and polarity based feature using supervised learning techniques for classifying. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:11      , Many automatic classifiers are proposed for classifying the texts in the given expressions but with the restricted domains, but there will be new informal words that are added to the present world which means something in the common social network, so there is a need to include all the common referred terms that are used in the social networking world.  , Objectives , The objectives of the paper has been discussed in the following points :- , 1. To explore, analyze and study the existing sentiment analysis detection techniques in the online microblogging network. , 2. To study how the tweets can be generated from the Twitter with the help of Java API. , 3. To implement and analyze the results achieved after applying the supervised , 4. Learning classifiers to the dataset.  , III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The main aim of this paper is to compare the results that are implemented with the help of supervised classifier. , The paper follows the following methodology : , 1. We have collected a corpus of positive, negative and neutral tweets with the help of Twitter4j java API from , Twitter. The size of our corpus is large. , 2. We then remove the stop words from the collected corpus to make the content free from commas, full stops etc. , 3. Lastly, we  apply machine learning algorithms to our training set first and then test set and compare the results. , With the help of results we evaluate which machine learning algorithm is best for classification of data.  , Preprocessing , Collection of data: We collected data from Twitter API named as Twitter4j using netbeans. given by using Hashtag(#) followed by the movie name like #FAN, #BajarangiBhaijaan, #TheJungleBook etc. Approx 17000 tweets have been collected from the various movie tweets. , Reviews can also be searched by #Hash tags followed by respective movie stars, directors, production‟s house and music record companies. In Twitter, hash tags become the necessary symbol to find about something and it gives user limit of 140 words to express their views and attitude.  , Normalization , We have found that to get desired results from the classifier we have to make sure that  the tweets can be processed properly. As tweets can be in user language, so we have to clean the data which is irrelevant to the classification. The things which can be irrelevant are as follows :-  URL: URLs in the message will not make any sense as it simply distracts the result of classifier.  Username: Removal of username can be necessary for cleaning purposes as it can effect falsely to our results.  Repeated characters: If the character is repeated more than two times then it can  comprise new word but the meaning is the same, so we have to eliminate that word and make the word genuine. For example „good‟ can be written as „gooooood‟.  , Repeated words If the message contains word which has appeared more than two times continuously then it has to be changed into two times. For example, „great great great great movie‟ can be converted to „great great movie‟.  , Removal of stop words , Stop words are words like “a”, ”is”, ”the”, “etc” etc; These words have nothing to do with the emotion , so has to be discarded from the message. Now, the next step is to train the data using supervised classifier.  , Machine Learning Techniques , We employed classification methods which is polarity based using set of positive, negative and neutral tweets provided by , Twitter4j API. Polarity is given by ratio of probability of a word appeared in set of positive or negative statement which makes the word positive or negative. The classifiers we are using are based on the concept of polarity. , If the feature is independent and based only on Standard English , ...]\n",

However, currently availab le algorithms focus basically on the recognition of modern coins. To date, no optical recognition system fo r coins has been researched successfully. In this paper, an algorithm based on unequally spaced frequency Fourier transforms is proposed for the recognition of coins. The performance of proposed algorithm is measured in terms of mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio.

INTRODUCTION  , Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our life. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines etc. In-spite of daily uses, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purpose by the organizations that deal with the ancient coins. The three main coin recognition systems are mechanical method based systems, electromagnetic method based systems and image processing based systems   [4]   [5].   , The   mechanical   method   based systems use parameters like diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of the coin to differentiate between the coins. But these parameters cannot be used to differentiate between the different materials of the coins i.e. if we provide two coins original and the fake having same diameter, thickness, weight and  magnetism but  with  different  materials then  such system will not be able to differentiate the original co in. The electromagnetic method based systems can differentiate between different materials because in these systems the coins are passed through an oscillating coil at a certain frequency and different materials bring d ifferent changes in the amplitude and direction of frequency. So these changes and the other parameters   like   diameter,   thickness,   weight   and magnetis m can be used to differentiate between coins. The electromagnetic based coin recognition systems improve the accuracy of recognition but still they can be fooled by some game co ins. In the recent years coin recognition systems based on images have also come into picture [8]. In these systems, first of all the image of the coin to be recognized is taken  either by camera or by some scanning. Then these images are processed by various image processing techniques like FFT, , DCT, edge detection, segmentation etc. and further various features are extracted from the images which are used to recognize different coins.  , II.        LITERATURE S URVEY  , An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) bas e d Automated Coin  , Recognition System [2] is proposed for the recognition of , Indian Coins of denomination `1, `2, `5 and `10 with rotation invariance. Since the images are  taken from  both  sides  of  coin,  so  this system  is  capable  of  recognizing  coins  from  both sides.  Features a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  i m a g e s  u s i n g  techniques    of    Hough    Transformat ion,    Pattern  , Averaging etc.  and then  the  extracted  features  are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. An algorithm for recognit ion of the co ins of d ifferent denomination is presented [3]. The proposed system first uses a canny edge detection to generate an edge map and then uses CHT (Circu lar Hough transform) to recognize the coins and further find the radii of them. In [1], authors presented an approach based on image subtraction technique for recognition of , Indian Coins. In [7], authors presented the coin identification approach in which images of coin are taken from different angles and a databank is created. By using this databank, data is providing to the neural network fo r its training. An image based approach for coin recognition using gabor wavelet for feature extract ion is provided [6].  , III.PROPOS ED COIN RECOGNITION S YSTEM  , The fo llowing  steps are performed  in  the proposed coin recognition system:  , Step 1:   Develop a RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLA B. , Step 2: The Pre-processing of a coin image is perfo rmed for recognizing the type of coin. , Step 3: Unequally spaced frequency Fourier transform is applied. , Step  4: The  training  &  testing  phase  of  neural network  with  rotation  invariance  is  applied  during coin recognition. , Step 5:  The results are displayed in the form of MSE and , PSNR , In this section we present recent approaches for coin recognition techniques, namely algorithms based on the , Eigen space approach, gradient features, contour and texture features. Finally, we discuss some preliminary   results   of   tests   performed   on   the muscle cis coin dataset.  , Research Article                                                                                                                              Volume 7 Issue No.4    , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10310                                                                 http://ijesc.org/    , 3.1 Coin detection , Hough transform is based on feature points extracted from the original image and usually, edges are used as the feature points. Various edge detection methods have been used for different applications. If Sobel filter is used to a coin image, large number of edge points are obtained from texture of the coin can be regarded as noise, which will induce a huge overhead   in   the   execution   time   of   the   Hough transform and most importantly will produce measurement errors, so technique to reduce the unwanted edge is sought. , Fig. 2 shows the result of applying Sobel filters to given input image (Fig. 1). The canny edge detector is very powerful tool for detecting edges in a noisy environment. Canny edge detector can remove most of the edge points. Canny gives thin edge as compared to the Sobel. Hence, canny edge detector has used for eliminating the unwanted edges that can result from , Sobel. Based on the smoothed image, derivatives in both the x and y direction are computed, these in turn are used to compute the gradient magnitude of the image.  Once the gradient magnitude of the image has been c o m p u t e d , a  p r o c e s s  c a l l e d  n o n  m a x i m u m  suppression is performed; in which pixels are suppressed if they do not constitute a local maximum.   Figure.1. Sample Coin image   Figure.2. Result of Sobel Filter   Figure.3. Result of Canny Edge Detection.  , The final step in the canny edge detector is to use hysteresis operator, in which p ixels are marked as edges, non edges and in-between based on threshold values. The next step is to consider each of the pixels that are in-between, if they are connected to edge pixels these are marked as edge pixels as well. The result of this edge detector is a binary image in which the white pixels closely approximate the true edges of the original image as shown in , Fig. 3.  , 3.2Coin verification , In general the appearance of one coin pattern varies considerably with respect to its grey values. These variations frequently are inhomogeneous and this suggests  that  fo r recognit ion  purposes, grey values by themselves will not give us appropriate results. On the other hand, edge information  remains more or less stable or at least degrades gracefully. So  the proposed research work is based on the detection on  edges.  In princip le any edge detector may be used for this purpose but Canny edge operator and the Laplacian of , Gaussian method provides more satisfactory results. As a result of the edge operator we either get a binary (edge) image or a list of coord inates at edge pixel locations.  , Let I : M× N → R[0,1] be an intensity image. M× N gives the  index space and  R[0,1] are  the  intensity values taken from the closed interval [0, 1]. E(x, y) ={ 1, if I(x, y) is an edge point , 0, els e   , 3.3 Coin recognition , Neural networks  give effect ive  resu lts fo r solving mult iple  class classification problems. Neural network has three types of layers: input layer, output layers and hidden layers. Hidden layer does intermediate computation before direct ing the input to output layer. Back propagation can also be considered as a generalization of delta rule. When back propagation network is cycled, an input pattern is propagated forward to the output units through the intervening input to hidden and hidden to output weights. Neural network have been widely used in image and signal processing. In our proposed work, neural network with rotation invariance is applied during coin recognition.  , IV .RES ULTS &DISCUSS ION  , 4.1 Performance metrics , MSE and PSNR are the two error metrics used to compare image quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the compressed and the original image, whereas , PSNR represents a measure of the peak error and these can be computed as:   In above equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images, respectively. PSNR can be calculated as: In   the   previous   equation,   R   is   the   maximum fluctuation in the input image e.g. if the input image has a double-precision floating data type, then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255.    , 4.2 Experimental results  , Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of the outcomes of the proposed coin recognition system used for identifying the coin by using the neural networks.   , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10311                                                                 http://ijesc.org/   Figure.4.

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  , Index Terms—Computer vision, Edge detection, Image processing, Pixel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , Date of Submission: 10-10-2020                                                                           Date of Acceptance: 26-10-2020 , ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  , I. Introduction The edge detection methods has a significant role in image processing work. By using image processing, we can use computational power for variety of applications [6]. We can use edge detection techniques in different fields of industry and agriculture [16]. The purpose of edge detection is to point out the differences and to identify the physical occurrence which produces them. Image edge information contains a lot of information [4]. Edge detection must be convenient because the validity, competence, and probability of the completion of successive processing phase depends on it. The segregation of the image into the background and object is a critical step in the image interpretation. Edges are the boundary between different textures. Edge is the discontinuities in the image intensity from one pixel to another. Detection of the edges for an image may help for data compression, data segmentation, and image reconstruction [2]. Edge detection is difficult in the noisy image since both the noise and edge contain high-frequency contents. Attempt to reduce the noise results makes the image more noisy and result in distorted image. Filters are used in the process of identifying the images by pointing and locating the discontinuities which brings the changes into pixel intensity are the boundary of an image. We always need a good edges for higher level processing.  An accurate and fast edge detector can upgrade the performance for complete processing system [19]. There are a lot of edge detection techniques available and each designed with a certain type of features. Since basic of image processing for object detection is edge detection, it is pivotal to have a good grasp of the edges detection techniques. In the fig. 1, the gradient vector of an edge pixel is shown. The intensity for each pixel changes from 0 to 255 in the gradient direction. strength of the edge is indicated by the magnitude of the gradient. An edge pixel is identified by using two traits, the edge strength which is the magnitude of the gradient, and the edge direction which is the angle of the gradient.

Operators can be easily optimized to look for diagonal, vertical, or horizontal edges. There are many ways to perform edge detection, but the majority of the techniques can be classified into two groups: · Gradient-based edge detection: The gradient method finds edge by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. · Laplacian based edge detection: The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image [14-17]. An edge has the shape of a ramp which is one-dimensional and location can be easily highlighted by calculating the derivative of the image [11]. Assume we have the following signal, with an edge shown by the jump in intensity below:   Fig.2 Intensity jump  , If we consider the gradient of this signal (which, in one dimension, is just the first derivative concerning for to t) we get the following:     Fig.3 First derivative  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              8 | Page , II. Methodology 1. There are a lot of problems due to false edge detection, missing true edges, in edge detection techniques production of thick or thin lines are problems due to noise.  The visual comparison is analyzed in this paper which is the most  used Laplacian and Gradient-based Edge Detection techniques for problems of faulty edge detection, missing real edges, problems due to noise, and producing thick or thin lines, etc. In this paper, different edge detection algorithms are compared to find an efficient and superior edge detection algorithm. , Different edge detection method , 2.  , 2.1 Sobel operator Sobel edge detection is considered a traditional method used in image processing techniques. The Sobel kernels are suitable to detect edges along the vertical and horizontal axis. The Sobel operator is based on convolving the image with a separable, small, and integer-valued filter [13]. The Sobel uses two pairs of 3x3 kernels for x and y-direction.                                         , -1  0  +1  , -2  0  +2  , -1  0  +1  +1  +2  +1  , 0  0  0  , -1  -2  -1      , Table.1 x-direction   Table.2 y-direction the kernel is rotated by 90°.  This method is used to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction of each image pixel. The magnitude of the vector is given as:     ∆f = mag(∆f) = [Gx, 2+GY, 2]½………………….(1)  , 1.2 Prewitt edge detection , Prewitt edge method matches with Sobel edge method. Prewitt edge detection masks are one of the old and well-understood methods of detecting edges in images. It is widely used for detecting horizontal and vertical edges and gives those points where there is maximum gradient [12]. The strength of the edge at the given point is then the square root of the sum of the squares of two derivatives. , 1.3 Canny edge detector , Canny edge detection detects a wide range of edges in image. It is a multi-step algorithm which can detect edges with noise suppressed at the time [5]. It was proposed to buy Canny in 1986. the initial level, it applies a , Gaussian filter that smooths the image to wipe out the noise. The main problem with this type of edge detection approach is a high threshold misses important edges and a low threshold produces false. , 1.4 Robert edge detection , This operator executes a gradient detection using the difference between adjacent pixels in the diagonal direction [3]. In Robert edge detection, the horizontal and vertical edges are calculated individually and then put together for resulting edge detection [18]. It approximates the gradient intensity in discrete differentiation, which is obtained by the summation of squares of differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. The Roberts edge detector computes 2-D spatial gradient on the image [8]. It uses a pair of 2x2 convoluted kernels, which is like a , Sobel edge method. Roberts x, y kernels is mentioned below:                                                                                                                                                 Table.3 Gx                    Table.4 Gy   1.5 Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) , This method of edge detection was invented in 1980 by Marr and Hildreth. In this method, the Laplacian is combined with Gaussian filtering change the image where the intensity varies to detect the edges effectively. It finds the actual place of edges and testing large area around the pixels. The disadvantage of the LOG operator is that it cannot find out the orientation of edge because of the Laplacian filter. The use of gaussian operator in , LOG  formulation is to smooth the image and  use the zero crossing to the location of edges [7].   All of these techniques can be grouped into three modules      • Gradient (estimate of the 1stderivative)        • Laplacian (Zero crossing detectors) derivative)         • Image approximation algorithm +1  0    0  1  , 0  +1    -1  0  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              9 | Page                 , Table.5  , 3. Mathematical morphological operators In a morphological operation, each and every pixel in the image is compared based on the value of other pixels in its area of neighbourhood [1]. A structuring element is a special filtering tool that enhances an input image. It can be of different sizes and different shapes. In mathematical morphology, a gradient image can be considered as a topological surface where the numerical value of each pixel indicates the evaluation of their points [10]. , These are Some of the main mathematical morphological operators: , 2.1 Dilation , It is the highest value in the window. The image after dilation becomes brighter or the intensity increases because of the maximum value in the window. It expands the image and is mainly used to fill the gap. Dilation process expands image objects by changing pixels with a value of “1” from“0”. , 2.2 Erosion , It is not at all similar to dilation. It is the lowest value in the window. The image after Erosion will be darker than the original image. It shrinks or thins the image. This process shrinking objects or images by changing pixels with a value of “1” to “0”. , 2.3 Opening and closing , Both opening and closing parameters are formed by using erosion and dilation. In the opening, firstly image will be eroded and then it will be followed by dilation. And in case of closing, firstly image will be dilated and then followed by erosion. , A. Mean Squared Error , The average of the squares of the \"errors\" is measured by the mean squared error of an estimator i.e. the difference between what is estimated and estimator. The contrast happens due to randomness or as a result of the estimator doesn’t calculate information that could result in a better accurate estimate. The PSNR differ inversely with the MSE. , The mean square error is the squared error averaged over the M × N array.  , MSE=1/MN ∑ ∑ (f1(m,n)- f2(m,n))2 ………………….(1)     Where f1 (m, n) and  f2 (m, n) are the output and input images respectively and M, N are the dimensions of the image. Its value must be less. , RMSE=√MSE , B. Peak signal to noise ratio , Peak signal to noise ratio is the ratio between the power of corrupting noise and the most significant possible power of a signal. It is represented by PSNR. Here, PSNR refers to the ratio between the edge detected images i.e. the estimator output and the ground truth image which is also referred to be the estimated image. It is the logarithmic function of the peak value of the image and the mean square error. Usually, PSNR is expressed in decibel scale. PSNR can be rated by the following Equation 2: , PSNR=10 LOG(2552/MSE) ………………….(2) , Where MSE is mean square error. Its value must be high.  , Original images are shown below and algorithms are applied to it.

Comparison of Techniques          , Table.6  , For image 1 we have calculated MSE and PSNR for different methods of different edge detection techniques. In the experimental analysis, we came across to analyze that canny operators have been the most efficient and effective method for the detection of edges. Different edge detectors works better under the different cases and conditions, there cannot be any algorithm that make use of multiple edge detectors [15].           , Table.7  , Similarly, we have to calculate the same for image 2. Under this experimental analysis, we find the same that the canny operator for this method has worked out well in all aspects. , We obtained different images for different edge detection techniques. All of them are different in some aspects and the most efficient method is the canny edge detection technique in both cases. All other methods have some blur and noisy labels that affect the efficiency of the image as compared to the canny edge detection techniques.     , 7.  , ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Removal of background noise is one of the crucial task because the speech signal should not be harmed by noise signal. Typically many speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed by concentrating only on short-time magnitude spectrum or else by compensating the phase spectrum by keeping the magnitude spectrum unchanged. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique by changing both magnitude and phase spectra  to improve the quality of a speech signal by producing an modified complex spectrum. In simulation results, both objective speech quality measure PESQ and spectrogram analysis has shown the performance of an enhanced speech signal.  Keywords - speech enhancement, magnitude spectrum, phase spectrum compensation. , 1. INTRODUCTION , Speech enhancement is nothing but noise suppression technology. It perceives most  important significance to improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signal in the noise environments. Natural background noises are sounds better when compared to unwanted twisted noises such as  traffic sounds, music sounds, some other person is speaking in the background etc, which may degrades the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the desired speech signal.  , Enhancement of speech signal is based on magnitude and phase spectrum compensation to restore the original signal from several background noises. , Let the noisy speech be defined as \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 1  where  represents discrete-time signals of noisy speech,  represents original speech  represents noise component. , The discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a set of real and complex numbers of  to produce a periodic function of frequency variable. Therefore, the DSTFT of the corrupted speech signal is defined as , ⁄ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2  where  defines as the kth discrete frequency of uniformly spaced  frequencies and  is an analysis window function. Therefore by using DSTF transform Eq.(1) can be represented as , , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 3  where , , ,  and ,  represents DSTF transform’s of the total noise speech,  clean speech, and noise, respectively. The above equation is determined to describe each part of the speech signal in terms of the DSTFT magnitude spectrum and the DSTFT phase spectrum. Here, the clean speech signal ,  can be represented in terms of polar form as , | , | , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4  where | , | is the magnitude spectrum, and ∠ ,  is the phase spectrum. , Many of the existing speech enhancement algorithms to remove the noisy speech as well as to look at the effects of intelligibility of speech signal to improve the quality of the speech signal. Actually, the speech signal is converted into polar form to generate magnitude and phase spectrum of the speech signal with respect to frequency. Here, many of the speech models has been proposed for speech enhancement, which is based only on the statistical model of magnitude to produce a modified complex spectrum. Thus, the modified complex spectrum is known as the estimated clean speech spectrum. , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 112, The following are some of the existing speech enhancement algorithm which is used to change only the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech signal and then combines with the unchanged phase spectrum to form a modified complex spectrum. Boll proposed Spectral subtraction (SSUB) in 1979. The basic idea of this method is that the noisy speech signal is the combination of both clean speech and noise as shown in Eqn.(1). Now, the magnitude spectrum of noise is get subtracted by the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech. Therefore, the resultant magnitude spectrum of clean speech is combines with the unchanged phase spectrum[2] to obtain modified complex spectrum. Wiener filter[4]was proposed by Wiener. Hansen and Jensen. The basic principle of the weiner filter is to obtain an estimate of clean signal from the signal corrupted by the noise component. The estimate clean speech is obtained by minimizing the mean square error(MSE) between the desired signal  and the estimated signal ̂ . The MMSE estimator[3], which is presented by Ephraim and Malah in 1984. The MMSE method is analyzed by using short time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator to enhance the desired speech signal quality. This method is also based on statistical analysis. Doclo and Moonen further extended the Wiener method in the mutil-channel case [6]. Ephraim and Van Trees proposed the linear predictive factors to estimate the pure speech signal[7]. , Conventional speech enhancement method enhances the magnitude spectrum and usue the corrupted speech phase spectrum for signal recovery. Mainly, all the existing are used to change the magnitude spectrum of the speech signal because the phase spectrum provides less perceptual effect at high signal to noise ratio(SNR) level[8].Later, it has been found that phase spectrum is also helpful for  speech enhancement applications[9]. , This paper proposed a novel method by focusing on both components such as magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a speech signal to improve the quality and intelligibility of a speech signal. The quality of the sppech signal is measured by PESQ (Perceptual Estimation of Speech Quality) score compared with conventional methods. , 2. LITERATURE REVIEW i. Spectral subtractive algorithms: , In AMS (analysis–modification–synthesis) framework, the modulation domain processing was added by Paliwaland Schwerin[10]. To know the importance of the modulation stage for speech intelligibility, they had done three experiments, they are , 1. Investigate the relative contributions to intelligibility of the modulation magnitude , 2. Modulation phase, and  , 3. Acoustic phase spectra.   , In these 3 experiments they found that that the intelligibility of stimuli constructed from only y the modulation magnitude or phase spectra is significantly lower than the intelligibility of the acoustic magnitude spectrum. So here we can recognize that there is an effect of the modulation frame duration on intelligibility for both, the modulation magnitude and phase spectrum as the speech reconstructed from only the short-time modulation phase spectrum has highest intelligibility when long modulation frame durations (>256 ms) are used. ii. Statistical-model-based algorithms , The effects of window shape and its length on the quality of phase-only and also magnitude-only reconstructed speech was investigated by Loveimi, Ahadi (Loveimi, Ahadi, 2010)[11]. The Speech signal is reconstructed through Least Square Error Estimation (LSEE) and Overlap Add (OLA) methods from its magnitude-only and phase-only spectra. If we want to reconstruct the speech from its magnitude spectrum they select sequence of random uniformly distributed numbers in the range of (−  , , ), as the phase sequence, or substitute phase spectrum with zero. iii. Subspace algorithms , The Combined TSP method gives a relatively better performance compared to temporal or spectral processing alone was invented by Krishnamoorthy &  Prasanna[11]. They propose a noisy speech enhancement method by combining linear prediction (LP) residual weighting in the time domain and spectral processing in the frequency domain is used  to provide better noise suppression as well as better enhancement in the speech regions. By estimating the sum of the peaks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum, the gross level features are computed. Using the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation the fine level features are identified. This system is performed only on the high SNR regions of the spectrally processed speech. , 3. PROPOSED METHOD , In our proposed method a noisy speech signal is transformed into magnitude and phase spectrum to produce a modified complex spectrum to obtain better intelligibility and high speech quality. , The magnitude spectrum of clean speech is defined as  √2 2 1 2, 2 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 5  where ∙  and ∙  represents the modified Bessel functions of zero and first order, respectively.  can be defined as  , 1 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 6  , Implementation of Magnitude and Phase Spectrum Compensation to Achieve an Enhanced Speech Signal 113   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 where  and  can de defined as  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 7              , Fig. 1.

Zero weighting is applied to the values of  non conjugate vectors of DSTF transform (i.e,\\t 0 and 2⁄  for ).The next step is to generate a phase spectrum compensation to reduce the noise of the speech signal and to generate a complex spectrum. , , Λ , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 10  Now the phase spectrum compensation function is obtained by ∠ , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 11  ARG=complex angle function , The above equation is giving the information about magnitude estimation and compensated phase spectrum.

The output of this may be complex because it is in time representation. So in PSC method the imaginary part is removed. And the final result, i.e enhanced time domain signal is obtained by applying overlap-Add method procedure, ̂ . 4. DISCUSSION , 1. A clean speech is corrupted by the noise at the receiver section.

The proposed system aims to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks. The proposed system is tested on real time recognition from a web camera and on the publicly available dataset. , The experimental results, which were obtained on publicly available data sets of fingerprint and 2D face, show tha t the proposed method is highly competitive compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and the analysis of the general image quality of real biometric samples reveals highly valuable information which may be very efficiently used to discriminate them from fake traits.  , Index Terms- Attacks, biometrics, countermeasures, image quality assessment, security.   , I. INTRODUCTION  , The  interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security has been increasing day by day that  leads to the creation of numerous and very diverse initiatives that focused on this  field of research[1] that includes the publication of many research works disclosing and evaluating different biometric vulnerabilities[2], [3], the proposal of new protection methods[4, 5, 6],  related book chapters[7] the publication of several standards in the area, the dedication of specific track sessions and workshops in biometric-specific and general signal processing conferences[8, 19],and the organization of competitions that focused on vulnerability assessment, the acquisition of specific datasets, the creation of groups and the laboratories specialized in the evaluation of biometric security, or there may be the existence of several European , Projects with the biometric security topic as main research interest.  , The above all these initiatives clearly highlight the importance given by all parties that involved in the development of biometrics  to the improvement of the systems security that brings  rapidly emerging technology into practical use. The speed and very low complexity of the proposed technique is an added advantage that makes it very well suited to operate on real scenarios (one of the desired characteristics of this type of methods). As we know that it does not deploy  any trait-specific property (e.g., minutiae points or face detection), the computation load needed for image processing purposes is very reduced and by   using only general image quality measures fast to compute and combined with very simple classifiers. , The system has been tested on publicly available attack databases of fingerprint and 2D face and also on real time. The proposed system has reached results fully comparable to those obtained on the same databases and here we follow the same experimental protocols by more complex trait-specific top-ranked approaches from the state-of-the-art.  , II. LITERATURE SURVEY  , In the entitled Paper Javier (Galbally Z.Wei, 2014), introduced a novel software-based multi-biometric and multi-attack protection method that targets to overcome part of limitations through the use of image quality assessment (IQA). It is not capable of operating with a very good performance under different biometric systems and also for diverse spoofing scenarios. In the paper (Poonam Dabas , Z.Wei, 2013), introduced objective methods for measuring the quality of images. In this paper, the proposed method focused on the various quality measures and an algorithm to model HVS (Human , Visual System). The properties of HVS are perceived brightness and frequency response and HVS is used to process input images. , The Approach of this paper [9] is based on the fact that hiding information in digital media requires alterations of the signal properties that introduce some form of degradation. The addition of a watermark or message leaves unique artifacts that can be detected using Image Quality Measures (IQM) is shown in this paper. The paper proves that image quality assessment can be used to discriminate between cover images and , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 50 stego-images. The paper also proves that the hypothesis that message-embedding scheme leave statistical evidence or structure in images that can be exploited for detection. In this paper [9], a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications is proposed. The index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors:  , A. Loss of Correlation Here, the degree of linear correlation between x and y is measured. Its dynamic range [-1, 1].  , B. Luminance Distortion   It will measure how close the mean luminance is between x and y. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1].  , C. Contrast Distortion It will measure how much similar are the contrasts are. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1]. The paper proves that the index outperforms the traditional method of error calculation of images for quality.  , III. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR , LIVENESS DETECTION  , In this paper, we have assumption that: “It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed.” Here, expected quality differences between real and fake samples may include: degree of sharpness, color and luminance levels, local artifacts, amount of information found in both type of images (entropy), structural distortions or natural appearance like face images captured from a mobile device will probably be over- or under-exposed; and fingerprint images captured from a gummy finger present local acquisition artifacts such as spots and patches. By following this “quality-difference” hypothesis, in the present research work we explore the potential of general image quality assessment as a protection method against different biometric attacks. Since the implemented features do not evaluate any specific property of a given biometric modality or of a specific attack so they may be computed on any image and the proposed method gives a new multi-biometric dimension. In the proposed state-of-the-art, the reasons behind the use of IQA features for liveness detection is supported by three factors:  , 1. The previous works for image manipulation detection [11, 12], and steg analysis [13, 14] in the forensic field has successfully used image quality. To an extent, various spoofing attacks like  those which involve taking a picture of a facial image displayed in a 2D device (e.g., spoofing attacks with printed face images), may be regarded as a type of image manipulation which can be effectively detected, as shown in the proposed  research work, by the use of different quality features. , 2. The previous studies in the forensic area and different features measuring trait-specific quality properties have already been used for liveness detection purposes in fingerprint  applications [5].This work gives a solid basis to the use of image quality as a protection method in biometric systems. , 3. As human observers very often refer to the “different appearance” of real and fake samples to distinguish between them. So, different metrics and methods designed for IQA intend to estimate in an objective and reliable way the perceived appearance of images by humans. In the proposed system, we have used different quality measures to differentiate between real and fake images.  , IV. PROPOSED METHOD  , In this proposed method, we present a novel fake detection model which can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, using image quality assessment. In the designed system, for real time recognition, we are interfacing camera to Raspberry pi and the camera will capture face image of a person and send to controller. Face and iris of the person from the image will be recognized by the controller and the finger print module will take the finger print from the person and send to controller. Then after controller will recognize the finger print of person from the data base and if they are matched then it will display the data on display unit.   Fig.1 Architecture diagram for real time recognition from a   web camera  , A.  Proposed algorithm for real time recognition In real time recognition, at first we have collected at least 15 images from webcam and then after we have trained the collected images by using Linear , Discriminant Analysis and finally we have tested the image of the same person (again image is taken from webcam).We have grabbed fingerprint of the person , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 51 from fingerprint scanner. Step wise description is given below.  , 1) Proposed Face Recognition The process of putting a label to a known face is known as face recognition. The proposed algorithm includes the following four steps:  , I. Face Detection , II. Face preprocessing , III. Training real time faces using Linear , Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , IV. Face Recognition  , Face Detection , The process of locating a face region in an image is face detection. In the proposed system, we have used , Haar-based cascade classifier for face detection. This algorithm works for frontal faces, side-view faces, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  , Haar based cascade classifier: , It is an effective face detection method. At first, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) [15, , 19] to train the classifier. After that, we need to extract features from it. Following are the Haar features:   Fig.2.Haar features  , The above features are just like our convolutional kernel and each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. Then all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features. We need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles for each feature calculation. Integral images are introduced to solve this and it simplifies the calculation and among all calculated features, most of them are irrelevant. So we will get over 160000 features and among them, we have to select the best feature and to obtain the best feature, we apply each and every feature on all the training images. It finds the best threshold which will classify the faces to positive and negative for each feature. The concept of this classifier is that instead of using all features on a window, group the features into different stages of classifiers and apply one-by-one. , Haar based cascade classifier using openCV: , In openCV, XML files [15] are stored and contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. , There are many cascade classifier in openCV like face detector, eye detector, mouth detector, etc.  , Steps for Face Detection:  , Loading Haar detector: , Here, pre trained XML file is loaded to perform face detection.  a. Accessing the webcam , Here, we access the webcam from the computer to grab the image.  b. Detecting a face using the Haar Classifier , Before detecting face in camera frame, we should perform the following steps:  i. Grayscale color conversion , As face detection only works on grayscale images. , Therefore, we should convert the color camera frame to grayscale.  ii. Shrinking the camera image , The size of the input image determines the speed of face detection i.e. it is very slow for large images but it is very fast for small images and detection is fairly even for low resolution. Thus, we should shrink the camera image to a more reasonable size.   iii. Histogram equalization , We should perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast and brightness because face detection is not as reliable in low-light conditions. , After performing these above preprocessing steps, we can now detect the face.  iv) Face pre-processing , As face recognition is extremely vulnerable to changes in lighting conditions, face orientation, face expression, thus, it is very important to reduce these differences as much as possible. In the proposed system, we have used histogram equalization for face preprocessing. For our convenience, the proposed system only uses eye detection and we ignore other facial features like mouth, nose etc.  v) Eye detection , It is a very useful for face preprocessing, because for frontal faces we can always assume a person's eyes should be horizontal and on opposite locations of the face and should have a fairly standard position and size within a face, although there are changes in facial , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 52 expressions, lighting conditions, camera properties, distance to camera, and so on. We have used pre-trained XML files for eye detection. vi) Eye search regions , The proposed system shows both left and right eyes region with small rectangle when the system captures the image. After this step, we perform the following steps:  a) Geometrical transformation and cropping: It includes scaling, rotating, and translating the images so that the eyes are aligned and then followed by the removal of the forehead, chin, ears, and background from the face image.  b) Separate histogram equalization for left and right sides: This step standardizes the brightness and contrast on both the left- and right-hand sides of the face independently.  c) Smoothing: Here, the image noise using a bilateral filter is reduced.  d) Elliptical mask: Here, the elliptical mask removes some remaining hair and background from the face image.  vii) Training real time faces using LDA , We can easily collect the face from the camera. This step includes training phase and testing phase.  , Training phase: , Distinguishing between the faces from different people is training phase and collecting the faces from the camera is training set. After collecting faces from the camera, we should train the faces. , The proposed system is trained by using LDA.  , Linear Discriminant Analysis: , LDA is a powerful statistical face recognition technique that overcomes the limitation of Principle component analysis technique by applying the linear discriminant criterion [16].The criterion tries to maximize the ratio of the determinant of the between-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant of the within class scatter matrix of the projected samples. It helps to group images of the same class and separates images of different classes of the images. It is based on 1D eigenvector matrices that appear somewhat like faces when viewed as 2D images [12]. Its basic principle is that it calculates one special eigenvector and eigenvalue for each person. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to access internal data structures of LDA. These data structures are used for mathematical calculations. , These data structures are usually stored as floating-point numbers typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.They are often either a 1D row or column matrix.   viii) Face Recognition , In this step, we find that who a person is just from a facial image. Here we have used Fisher face algorithm for face recognition. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to recognize the faces. In openCV, there are many FaceRecognizer algorithms. , In our system, we have used Fisher face algorithm. , Face verification can be done to confirm if the result of the prediction is reliable or whether it should be taken as an unknown person.  , The facial verification can be done by reconstruction of facial images followed by calculating similarity between reconstructed images and input images. We use openCv functions to perform above steps. Thus, we have used fisher faces algorithm, it needs higher threshold so here we have used threshold, say 0.7.  , 2) Proposed Fingerprint recognition method Fingerprint is another biometric check to the system. , In the proposed system, we have used openCV for fingerprint. Here, we grab the fingerprint [18] of the person at registration time and then we verify the fingerprint at verification time in real time verification.  , Binarization:  , It is the process of converting a pixel image into binary image. At first, we grab the image from the fingerprint scanner and apply binarization. It enables us to remove any desired noise from the image and help us to make the contrast better between the kin and the wrinkled surface of the finger. In the proposed system, we have two phases: Register phase and another is verify phase.  , During register phase, fingerprint is grabbed from fingerprint scanner and features points are stored in the buffer in hexadecimal form. Now during verify phase, again the fingerprint is taken from fingerprint scanner and here also the feature points are stored in buffer in hexadecimal form. If the previous feature point values match with the current feature point then authentication is success otherwise authentication is failed.

PROPSED ALGORITHM FOR OFFLINE , DATASET  , In offline recognition, we have used publicly available dataset for both face and finger which is explained below.  , 1. Proposed Face Recognition: The proposed system includes mainly following three steps in face recognition: i)In first step, we have to find a good database of faces with multiple images for each individual. ii) The second step is to detect faces in the database images and use them to train the face recognizer. iii) The third step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.   , Dataset: , ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "

Existing some popular microblogs like , Twitter, Facebook etc, in which twitter attains maximum amount of attention in the field of research areas related to product, movie reviews, stock exchange etc. The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present days becomes the major issue in field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on the social networking websites, huge amount of data produces in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral. We had extracted data from twitter i.e. movie reviews for sentiment prediction using machine-learning algorithms. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), maximum entropy and Naïve Bayes to classify data using unigram, bigram and hybrid i.e. unigram + bigram features. Result shows that SVM surpassed other classifiers with remarkable accuracy of 84% for movie reviews.  , I. INTRODUCTION Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups. It could be an apolitical or religious group or a group of college students, teenagers, all together sharing information of their interests, mostly online. Twitter, MySpace or Facebook are some of the social networking sites that are free of charge and easy to access. This interaction is likely to include friendship, families, group relation and romantic ones. Social networking helps people to make new friends and develop some personal relationships and stay in touch with family very easily. Due to vast number of people connects to networking sites, number of relationships gradually increases. Social networking features combined in one website are: user groups, the latest info about music groups, places for videos and photos, blogs, personal profile, and much more. Social networking sites also helps people for maintaining and developing business contacts contact with them. LinkedIn is the best example for this, as it can be suitable place to talk about business and meet with professionals. , It is easier and faster to be involving with new business clients. , Internet is foremost and first communication technology with the capability to change social interaction of the people. Since early , 1990s, there has been a proliferation of internet. For example,by , 2003 63% of American had used the internet. In 1990s, , Information technology experts expected the internet to be consigned to the trash heap of history. Internet has become an essential part of our lives; many websites have facility ways for people to keep in touch in the form of social networking. Social networking sites are the way for interact with new people and to make connections as well as share photos, videos, and activities with each other. , According to Amanda Lenhart and Mary Madden,  55% of online teenagers have created a personal profile online, and 55% have used social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. , A social networking site includes both the exchange of information among individuals and groups online. Expression also represents a view perspective, reflection, or quality of the individual or groups.  Figure 1: Abstract view of social networking , In 1997, first social site was launched named sixdegree.com. , The intention of this site was to make online dating smoother, and for the first time users were able to create their personal profile and then post it online and even surf the network. After sixdegree.com, other social sites were launched, and served for a while, and failed to become a sustainable business entity. Since then Ryze.com (2002), match.com, were launched and used by many users. Uncontrolled use of microblogging separates the users from the real world life and creates shortage of attention. , Use of social networking site has disadvantages and advantages. , It is up to the interest and knowledge of the user to know how to use them, when and which site to use. , Social networking has some of the advantages like the meeting places but virtually where people can share thoughts with whoever they want and meet them in the first place. Some people used social networking sites to make new friends, establish relationships and even marry. Some of them used this websites, in order to find their lost friends in their life and meet them. Use of social networking makes life faster and easier to get the latest news across the world at any moment and being updated. Nowadays, colleges and universities are getting fond of social networking, which makes it easier for faculty and students to find information freely and easily. Corporate and technical sectors also started recruiting employees with the help of social networking by going through  their profile and background. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:9      , Since social networking sites are operating worldwide; it breaks some of the cultural  , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families barriers around the different parts of the world. , Different people from different parts of the world can be able to connect with their loved one and families easily and without any cost. Social networking brings the world together and modifies communication. Everything in the world has both advantages and disadvantages, even for social networking, the disadvantages are as follows; personal identity theft is the most popular one. , Social networking requires user‟s personal details in order to gain full access to the site as sign up. Recent information and news disclosed that some of the social networking websites misuses the personal information of users. Advertisers evade users‟ privacy. Sex offenders and criminals often visit the sites to find new victims. Some people mostly young ones for the sake of revenge and hate post embarrassing information or photos. These types of crimes can be categorized as cyber bullying in social networking makes this much faster and easier, unfortunately sometimes even led to death of teens. The developers made the social networking sites for better communication but people are rather addicted to those sites. This will hinder the ability of young people to develop real social life, face to face meeting of people, which is very important in developing conversation and speech. The traditional face to face socializing is becoming obsolete.  , Online Microblogging , Online microblogging is broadcast medium that exists similar to blogging.  Microblogging is different from blogging as its content normally smaller in both total and actual file size. , Microblogs allow users to share small chunks of content such as video link, individual images or short messages, which may be the major reason for their popularity.   , Advantages of Microblogging over traditional blogging:- Why would anyone want to start posting on a microblogging site? If you've been hesitant to jump on on a site like Twitter or , Tumblr, here are a few reasons to consider trying them , Developing content takes less time: The traditional blogs are quite lengthy so that it takes time to complete our intent. , Microblogging gives you the benefit of posting the most recently happened incident to aware your loved ones in a short time and message.   Individual parts of the content consumed in less time : Hence, microblogging  is such a popular and interactive form of information consumption and social media on mobile devices, because as the gist of the content to the people increases, therefore it is best way where the news comes in short and precise way as compare to long ones that takes time.  Increases chances of frequent posts: Microblogging involves the more frequent posts and shorter ones whereas traditional blogging involves exactly opposite less frequent post and longer. Since you're saving so much time by focusing on just posting short pieces, you `can afford to post more frequently.  Share time sensitive or urgent information in an easier way: Huge number of microblogging platforms have been made to be fast and easy to use. With a Vine video, Tumblr post, Instagram photo or a simple tweet, you can easily share to everyone on what's happening in your life or any news at this very moment.  Communication with followers becomes easy and direct : In addition to communicate easily with greater short and frequent posts, microblogging platforms can be used  easily to encourage and facilitate better  interaction  through liking, reblogging , tweeting , commenting and more.  Convenient using with mobile and tabs: Microblogging gains too much of attention in present days and the main cause behind this is increasing trends of mobile browsing. It is difficult to consume, interact and write long and lengthy blog post in a tab or smartphone that‟s why microblogging comes into play and provide small, easy and faster posts.  , Twitter , Twitter is an online microblogging service that allows users to read and write short sentences of length 140 characters called tweets. Twitter Inc. is located at San Francisco. Users should register first to post any message, whereas unregistered users can only read them. Users can access Twitter with the website interface, mobile application or SMS. Twitter was created by , Noah Glass, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey in , March 2006 and launched in July 2006. Twitter has 310 Million monthly active users, 1 billion unique visits monthly to sites with embedded tweets, 83% of active users access through mobile application, consists of 3500 employees around the world, more than 35 offices across the world, 79% accounts are from outside the U.S. , supports more than 40 languages and , 40% employees of Twitter are from technical background. All numbers approximate as of March 31, 2016. , The company experienced rapid initial growth. In year 2007 around 4,00,000 tweets were posted per quarter. In 2008 this extends to 10 million tweets a quarter. 50 millions tweets were posted per day in February 2010. 70000 applications were registered by company as March 2010. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:10       Figure 2: Twitter Logo , According to Twitter, 750 tweets are posted each second which equals to each day around 65 million tweets were posted as of , June 2010. On daily basis around 140 tweets were posted by , March 2011. In January 2009, since it gained a lot of popularity, , Twitter becomes third-highest online microblogging site, given by Compete.com. , The reason we are using microblogging and Twitter data are the following:  The scope of microblogging tends to grow bigger and bigger day by day. Easy to use and people can share and give opinions on a certain topic, thus it makes essential source.  Twitter generates vast number of messages that is increasing exponentially. The extracted data can be enormously large.  Twitter users varies from person to person as user can be politicians, film stars, celebrities, sportsmen and many leaders across the country. So, it contains all the messages of different caste, religion and sex.  Twitter users are all over the world so it contains data for different language.  , Sentiment Analysis , Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. Users share the things about their ongoing life, discuss current issues and variety of topics. , Independent to write in any format without following rules that makes this more popular than older blogging sites. Movies and product reviews easily available now a days or thoughts on religious and political issues, so it becomes essential sources of user sentiment and opinion. Data that are we using in our experiment are from Twitter, it contains a vast number of messages by large number of users created by themselves. , Messages can vary from public opinion to personal thought. , These microblogging sites are huge source of information and it is quite easy to say that there is a need for automating the sentiment analysis process as there is too much work involved in processing this information manually. Various approaches are practiced for the automation of this process like machine learning and natural language processing. Users are increasing day by day as the population and trend of using microblogging sites are increasing, so the data can be used in research purpose of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. , In the time of election every news channel show the exit polls of every political party. So, every political party willing to know how many are in favor can do so  with the help of microblogging sites where people will give their opinions about likes and dislikes of theirs party. These opinions will help parties to increase their voters. , The data we are using in this experiment are movie reviews. We have collected about 17000 movie reviews from Twitter. The movie reviews contains categorized in three ways: reviews of different movies. Reviews can be categorized in three ways: , 1. Positive reviews: Messages in which people liked the movie. , 2. Negative reviews: Messages in which people not liked the movie. , 3. Neutral reviews: Messages in which people do not have emotions or based on mere fact. , We have extracted 5000 each positive, negative and neutral reviews for training set and 2000 reviews will be used in test set. , We show comparison between the different machine learning classifiers and empirically conclude which will give the best result among these. , II. RESEARCH PROBLEM Problem Statement , Microblogging is type of blogging which consists of a limited number of words. Limitation of words determined by respective microblogging sites. It gives right to share his/her thoughts, opinions and sentiments in less number of words. It is one of the revolutionary things happening in the world of technology. , People these days depend upon microblogging sites such as , Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. to communicate with both relatives and rest of world. Here sentiments come into the play which will be shared by anyone in the time they feel and wanted it to be shared. Sentiments are nothing but feelings with respect to event or situation. Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. , The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present day is a prominent issue in the field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on social networking websites, a huge amount of data produced in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral.  , Gap Analysis , A lot of research has been done in the area of sentiment analysis. , Many researchers used Part-Of-Speech and polarity based feature using supervised learning techniques for classifying. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:11      , Many automatic classifiers are proposed for classifying the texts in the given expressions but with the restricted domains, but there will be new informal words that are added to the present world which means something in the common social network, so there is a need to include all the common referred terms that are used in the social networking world.  , Objectives , The objectives of the paper has been discussed in the following points :- , 1. To explore, analyze and study the existing sentiment analysis detection techniques in the online microblogging network. , 2. To study how the tweets can be generated from the Twitter with the help of Java API. , 3. To implement and analyze the results achieved after applying the supervised , 4. Learning classifiers to the dataset.  , III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The main aim of this paper is to compare the results that are implemented with the help of supervised classifier. , The paper follows the following methodology : , 1. We have collected a corpus of positive, negative and neutral tweets with the help of Twitter4j java API from , Twitter. The size of our corpus is large. , 2. We then remove the stop words from the collected corpus to make the content free from commas, full stops etc. , 3. Lastly, we  apply machine learning algorithms to our training set first and then test set and compare the results. , With the help of results we evaluate which machine learning algorithm is best for classification of data.  , Preprocessing , Collection of data: We collected data from Twitter API named as Twitter4j using netbeans. given by using Hashtag(#) followed by the movie name like #FAN, #BajarangiBhaijaan, #TheJungleBook etc. Approx 17000 tweets have been collected from the various movie tweets. , Reviews can also be searched by #Hash tags followed by respective movie stars, directors, production‟s house and music record companies. In Twitter, hash tags become the necessary symbol to find about something and it gives user limit of 140 words to express their views and attitude.  , Normalization , We have found that to get desired results from the classifier we have to make sure that  the tweets can be processed properly. As tweets can be in user language, so we have to clean the data which is irrelevant to the classification. The things which can be irrelevant are as follows :-  URL: URLs in the message will not make any sense as it simply distracts the result of classifier.  Username: Removal of username can be necessary for cleaning purposes as it can effect falsely to our results.  Repeated characters: If the character is repeated more than two times then it can  comprise new word but the meaning is the same, so we have to eliminate that word and make the word genuine. For example „good‟ can be written as „gooooood‟.  , Repeated words If the message contains word which has appeared more than two times continuously then it has to be changed into two times. For example, „great great great great movie‟ can be converted to „great great movie‟.  , Removal of stop words , Stop words are words like “a”, ”is”, ”the”, “etc” etc; These words have nothing to do with the emotion , so has to be discarded from the message. Now, the next step is to train the data using supervised classifier.  , Machine Learning Techniques , We employed classification methods which is polarity based using set of positive, negative and neutral tweets provided by , Twitter4j API. Polarity is given by ratio of probability of a word appeared in set of positive or negative statement which makes the word positive or negative. The classifiers we are using are based on the concept of polarity. , If the feature is independent and based only on Standard English , ...]</td>\n",

INTRODUCTION  , Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our life. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines etc. In-spite of daily uses, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purpose by the organizations that deal with the ancient coins. The three main coin recognition systems are mechanical method based systems, electromagnetic method based systems and image processing based systems   [4]   [5].   , The   mechanical   method   based systems use parameters like diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of the coin to differentiate between the coins. But these parameters cannot be used to differentiate between the different materials of the coins i.e. if we provide two coins original and the fake having same diameter, thickness, weight and  magnetism but  with  different  materials then  such system will not be able to differentiate the original co in. The electromagnetic method based systems can differentiate between different materials because in these systems the coins are passed through an oscillating coil at a certain frequency and different materials bring d ifferent changes in the amplitude and direction of frequency. So these changes and the other parameters   like   diameter,   thickness,   weight   and magnetis m can be used to differentiate between coins. The electromagnetic based coin recognition systems improve the accuracy of recognition but still they can be fooled by some game co ins. In the recent years coin recognition systems based on images have also come into picture [8]. In these systems, first of all the image of the coin to be recognized is taken  either by camera or by some scanning. Then these images are processed by various image processing techniques like FFT, , DCT, edge detection, segmentation etc. and further various features are extracted from the images which are used to recognize different coins.  , II.        LITERATURE S URVEY  , An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) bas e d Automated Coin  , Recognition System [2] is proposed for the recognition of , Indian Coins of denomination `1, `2, `5 and `10 with rotation invariance. Since the images are  taken from  both  sides  of  coin,  so  this system  is  capable  of  recognizing  coins  from  both sides.  Features a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  i m a g e s  u s i n g  techniques    of    Hough    Transformat ion,    Pattern  , Averaging etc.  and then  the  extracted  features  are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. An algorithm for recognit ion of the co ins of d ifferent denomination is presented [3]. The proposed system first uses a canny edge detection to generate an edge map and then uses CHT (Circu lar Hough transform) to recognize the coins and further find the radii of them. In [1], authors presented an approach based on image subtraction technique for recognition of , Indian Coins. In [7], authors presented the coin identification approach in which images of coin are taken from different angles and a databank is created. By using this databank, data is providing to the neural network fo r its training. An image based approach for coin recognition using gabor wavelet for feature extract ion is provided [6].  , III.PROPOS ED COIN RECOGNITION S YSTEM  , The fo llowing  steps are performed  in  the proposed coin recognition system:  , Step 1:   Develop a RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLA B. , Step 2: The Pre-processing of a coin image is perfo rmed for recognizing the type of coin. , Step 3: Unequally spaced frequency Fourier transform is applied. , Step  4: The  training  &amp;  testing  phase  of  neural network  with  rotation  invariance  is  applied  during coin recognition. , Step 5:  The results are displayed in the form of MSE and , PSNR , In this section we present recent approaches for coin recognition techniques, namely algorithms based on the , Eigen space approach, gradient features, contour and texture features. Finally, we discuss some preliminary   results   of   tests   performed   on   the muscle cis coin dataset.  , Research Article                                                                                                                              Volume 7 Issue No.4    , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10310                                                                 http://ijesc.org/    , 3.1 Coin detection , Hough transform is based on feature points extracted from the original image and usually, edges are used as the feature points. Various edge detection methods have been used for different applications. If Sobel filter is used to a coin image, large number of edge points are obtained from texture of the coin can be regarded as noise, which will induce a huge overhead   in   the   execution   time   of   the   Hough transform and most importantly will produce measurement errors, so technique to reduce the unwanted edge is sought. , Fig. 2 shows the result of applying Sobel filters to given input image (Fig. 1). The canny edge detector is very powerful tool for detecting edges in a noisy environment. Canny edge detector can remove most of the edge points. Canny gives thin edge as compared to the Sobel. Hence, canny edge detector has used for eliminating the unwanted edges that can result from , Sobel. Based on the smoothed image, derivatives in both the x and y direction are computed, these in turn are used to compute the gradient magnitude of the image.  Once the gradient magnitude of the image has been c o m p u t e d , a  p r o c e s s  c a l l e d  n o n  m a x i m u m  suppression is performed; in which pixels are suppressed if they do not constitute a local maximum.   Figure.1. Sample Coin image   Figure.2. Result of Sobel Filter   Figure.3. Result of Canny Edge Detection.  , The final step in the canny edge detector is to use hysteresis operator, in which p ixels are marked as edges, non edges and in-between based on threshold values. The next step is to consider each of the pixels that are in-between, if they are connected to edge pixels these are marked as edge pixels as well. The result of this edge detector is a binary image in which the white pixels closely approximate the true edges of the original image as shown in , Fig. 3.  , 3.2Coin verification , In general the appearance of one coin pattern varies considerably with respect to its grey values. These variations frequently are inhomogeneous and this suggests  that  fo r recognit ion  purposes, grey values by themselves will not give us appropriate results. On the other hand, edge information  remains more or less stable or at least degrades gracefully. So  the proposed research work is based on the detection on  edges.  In princip le any edge detector may be used for this purpose but Canny edge operator and the Laplacian of , Gaussian method provides more satisfactory results. As a result of the edge operator we either get a binary (edge) image or a list of coord inates at edge pixel locations.  , Let I : M× N → R[0,1] be an intensity image. M× N gives the  index space and  R[0,1] are  the  intensity values taken from the closed interval [0, 1]. E(x, y) ={ 1, if I(x, y) is an edge point , 0, els e   , 3.3 Coin recognition , Neural networks  give effect ive  resu lts fo r solving mult iple  class classification problems. Neural network has three types of layers: input layer, output layers and hidden layers. Hidden layer does intermediate computation before direct ing the input to output layer. Back propagation can also be considered as a generalization of delta rule. When back propagation network is cycled, an input pattern is propagated forward to the output units through the intervening input to hidden and hidden to output weights. Neural network have been widely used in image and signal processing. In our proposed work, neural network with rotation invariance is applied during coin recognition.  , IV .RES ULTS &amp;DISCUSS ION  , 4.1 Performance metrics , MSE and PSNR are the two error metrics used to compare image quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the compressed and the original image, whereas , PSNR represents a measure of the peak error and these can be computed as:   In above equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images, respectively. PSNR can be calculated as: In   the   previous   equation,   R   is   the   maximum fluctuation in the input image e.g. if the input image has a double-precision floating data type, then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255.    , 4.2 Experimental results  , Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of the outcomes of the proposed coin recognition system used for identifying the coin by using the neural networks.   , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10311                                                                 http://ijesc.org/   Figure.4.

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  , Index Terms—Computer vision, Edge detection, Image processing, Pixel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , Date of Submission: 10-10-2020                                                                           Date of Acceptance: 26-10-2020 , ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  , I. Introduction The edge detection methods has a significant role in image processing work. By using image processing, we can use computational power for variety of applications [6]. We can use edge detection techniques in different fields of industry and agriculture [16]. The purpose of edge detection is to point out the differences and to identify the physical occurrence which produces them. Image edge information contains a lot of information [4]. Edge detection must be convenient because the validity, competence, and probability of the completion of successive processing phase depends on it. The segregation of the image into the background and object is a critical step in the image interpretation. Edges are the boundary between different textures. Edge is the discontinuities in the image intensity from one pixel to another. Detection of the edges for an image may help for data compression, data segmentation, and image reconstruction [2]. Edge detection is difficult in the noisy image since both the noise and edge contain high-frequency contents. Attempt to reduce the noise results makes the image more noisy and result in distorted image. Filters are used in the process of identifying the images by pointing and locating the discontinuities which brings the changes into pixel intensity are the boundary of an image. We always need a good edges for higher level processing.  An accurate and fast edge detector can upgrade the performance for complete processing system [19]. There are a lot of edge detection techniques available and each designed with a certain type of features. Since basic of image processing for object detection is edge detection, it is pivotal to have a good grasp of the edges detection techniques. In the fig. 1, the gradient vector of an edge pixel is shown. The intensity for each pixel changes from 0 to 255 in the gradient direction. strength of the edge is indicated by the magnitude of the gradient. An edge pixel is identified by using two traits, the edge strength which is the magnitude of the gradient, and the edge direction which is the angle of the gradient. [9].   , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              7 | Page  Fig. 1 The gradient of pixel of an image  , The characteristic direction is determined by the geometry of the operator which is most sensitive to edges. Operators can be easily optimized to look for diagonal, vertical, or horizontal edges. There are many ways to perform edge detection, but the majority of the techniques can be classified into two groups: · Gradient-based edge detection: The gradient method finds edge by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. · Laplacian based edge detection: The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image [14-17]. An edge has the shape of a ramp which is one-dimensional and location can be easily highlighted by calculating the derivative of the image [11]. Assume we have the following signal, with an edge shown by the jump in intensity below:   Fig.2 Intensity jump  , If we consider the gradient of this signal (which, in one dimension, is just the first derivative concerning for to t) we get the following:     Fig.3 First derivative  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              8 | Page , II. Methodology 1. There are a lot of problems due to false edge detection, missing true edges, in edge detection techniques production of thick or thin lines are problems due to noise.  The visual comparison is analyzed in this paper which is the most  used Laplacian and Gradient-based Edge Detection techniques for problems of faulty edge detection, missing real edges, problems due to noise, and producing thick or thin lines, etc. In this paper, different edge detection algorithms are compared to find an efficient and superior edge detection algorithm. , Different edge detection method , 2.  , 2.1 Sobel operator Sobel edge detection is considered a traditional method used in image processing techniques. The Sobel kernels are suitable to detect edges along the vertical and horizontal axis. The Sobel operator is based on convolving the image with a separable, small, and integer-valued filter [13]. The Sobel uses two pairs of 3x3 kernels for x and y-direction.                                         , -1  0  +1  , -2  0  +2  , -1  0  +1  +1  +2  +1  , 0  0  0  , -1  -2  -1      , Table.1 x-direction   Table.2 y-direction the kernel is rotated by 90°.  This method is used to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction of each image pixel. The magnitude of the vector is given as:     ∆f = mag(∆f) = [Gx, 2+GY, 2]½………………….(1)  , 1.2 Prewitt edge detection , Prewitt edge method matches with Sobel edge method. Prewitt edge detection masks are one of the old and well-understood methods of detecting edges in images. It is widely used for detecting horizontal and vertical edges and gives those points where there is maximum gradient [12]. The strength of the edge at the given point is then the square root of the sum of the squares of two derivatives. , 1.3 Canny edge detector , Canny edge detection detects a wide range of edges in image. It is a multi-step algorithm which can detect edges with noise suppressed at the time [5]. It was proposed to buy Canny in 1986. the initial level, it applies a , Gaussian filter that smooths the image to wipe out the noise. The main problem with this type of edge detection approach is a high threshold misses important edges and a low threshold produces false. , 1.4 Robert edge detection , This operator executes a gradient detection using the difference between adjacent pixels in the diagonal direction [3]. In Robert edge detection, the horizontal and vertical edges are calculated individually and then put together for resulting edge detection [18]. It approximates the gradient intensity in discrete differentiation, which is obtained by the summation of squares of differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. The Roberts edge detector computes 2-D spatial gradient on the image [8]. It uses a pair of 2x2 convoluted kernels, which is like a , Sobel edge method. Roberts x, y kernels is mentioned below:                                                                                                                                                 Table.3 Gx                    Table.4 Gy   1.5 Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) , This method of edge detection was invented in 1980 by Marr and Hildreth. In this method, the Laplacian is combined with Gaussian filtering change the image where the intensity varies to detect the edges effectively. It finds the actual place of edges and testing large area around the pixels. The disadvantage of the LOG operator is that it cannot find out the orientation of edge because of the Laplacian filter. The use of gaussian operator in , LOG  formulation is to smooth the image and  use the zero crossing to the location of edges [7].   All of these techniques can be grouped into three modules      • Gradient (estimate of the 1stderivative)        • Laplacian (Zero crossing detectors) derivative)         • Image approximation algorithm +1  0    0  1  , 0  +1    -1  0  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              9 | Page                 , Table.5  , 3. Mathematical morphological operators In a morphological operation, each and every pixel in the image is compared based on the value of other pixels in its area of neighbourhood [1]. A structuring element is a special filtering tool that enhances an input image. It can be of different sizes and different shapes. In mathematical morphology, a gradient image can be considered as a topological surface where the numerical value of each pixel indicates the evaluation of their points [10]. , These are Some of the main mathematical morphological operators: , 2.1 Dilation , It is the highest value in the window. The image after dilation becomes brighter or the intensity increases because of the maximum value in the window. It expands the image and is mainly used to fill the gap. Dilation process expands image objects by changing pixels with a value of “1” from“0”. , 2.2 Erosion , It is not at all similar to dilation. It is the lowest value in the window. The image after Erosion will be darker than the original image. It shrinks or thins the image. This process shrinking objects or images by changing pixels with a value of “1” to “0”. , 2.3 Opening and closing , Both opening and closing parameters are formed by using erosion and dilation. In the opening, firstly image will be eroded and then it will be followed by dilation. And in case of closing, firstly image will be dilated and then followed by erosion. , A. Mean Squared Error , The average of the squares of the \"errors\" is measured by the mean squared error of an estimator i.e. the difference between what is estimated and estimator. The contrast happens due to randomness or as a result of the estimator doesn’t calculate information that could result in a better accurate estimate. The PSNR differ inversely with the MSE. , The mean square error is the squared error averaged over the M × N array.  , MSE=1/MN ∑ ∑ (f1(m,n)- f2(m,n))2 ………………….(1)     Where f1 (m, n) and  f2 (m, n) are the output and input images respectively and M, N are the dimensions of the image. Its value must be less. , RMSE=√MSE , B. Peak signal to noise ratio , Peak signal to noise ratio is the ratio between the power of corrupting noise and the most significant possible power of a signal. It is represented by PSNR. Here, PSNR refers to the ratio between the edge detected images i.e. the estimator output and the ground truth image which is also referred to be the estimated image. It is the logarithmic function of the peak value of the image and the mean square error. Usually, PSNR is expressed in decibel scale. PSNR can be rated by the following Equation 2: , PSNR=10 LOG(2552/MSE) ………………….(2) , Where MSE is mean square error. Its value must be high.  , Original images are shown below and algorithms are applied to it.

Removal of background noise is one of the crucial task because the speech signal should not be harmed by noise signal. Typically many speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed by concentrating only on short-time magnitude spectrum or else by compensating the phase spectrum by keeping the magnitude spectrum unchanged. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique by changing both magnitude and phase spectra  to improve the quality of a speech signal by producing an modified complex spectrum. In simulation results, both objective speech quality measure PESQ and spectrogram analysis has shown the performance of an enhanced speech signal.  Keywords - speech enhancement, magnitude spectrum, phase spectrum compensation. , 1. INTRODUCTION , Speech enhancement is nothing but noise suppression technology. It perceives most  important significance to improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signal in the noise environments. Natural background noises are sounds better when compared to unwanted twisted noises such as  traffic sounds, music sounds, some other person is speaking in the background etc, which may degrades the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the desired speech signal.  , Enhancement of speech signal is based on magnitude and phase spectrum compensation to restore the original signal from several background noises. , Let the noisy speech be defined as \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 1  where  represents discrete-time signals of noisy speech,  represents original speech  represents noise component. , The discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a set of real and complex numbers of  to produce a periodic function of frequency variable. Therefore, the DSTFT of the corrupted speech signal is defined as , ⁄ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2  where  defines as the kth discrete frequency of uniformly spaced  frequencies and  is an analysis window function. Therefore by using DSTF transform Eq.(1) can be represented as , , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 3  where , , ,  and ,  represents DSTF transform’s of the total noise speech,  clean speech, and noise, respectively. The above equation is determined to describe each part of the speech signal in terms of the DSTFT magnitude spectrum and the DSTFT phase spectrum. Here, the clean speech signal ,  can be represented in terms of polar form as , | , | , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4  where | , | is the magnitude spectrum, and ∠ ,  is the phase spectrum. , Many of the existing speech enhancement algorithms to remove the noisy speech as well as to look at the effects of intelligibility of speech signal to improve the quality of the speech signal. Actually, the speech signal is converted into polar form to generate magnitude and phase spectrum of the speech signal with respect to frequency. Here, many of the speech models has been proposed for speech enhancement, which is based only on the statistical model of magnitude to produce a modified complex spectrum. Thus, the modified complex spectrum is known as the estimated clean speech spectrum. , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 112, The following are some of the existing speech enhancement algorithm which is used to change only the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech signal and then combines with the unchanged phase spectrum to form a modified complex spectrum. Boll proposed Spectral subtraction (SSUB) in 1979. The basic idea of this method is that the noisy speech signal is the combination of both clean speech and noise as shown in Eqn.(1). Now, the magnitude spectrum of noise is get subtracted by the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech. Therefore, the resultant magnitude spectrum of clean speech is combines with the unchanged phase spectrum[2] to obtain modified complex spectrum. Wiener filter[4]was proposed by Wiener. Hansen and Jensen. The basic principle of the weiner filter is to obtain an estimate of clean signal from the signal corrupted by the noise component. The estimate clean speech is obtained by minimizing the mean square error(MSE) between the desired signal  and the estimated signal ̂ . The MMSE estimator[3], which is presented by Ephraim and Malah in 1984. The MMSE method is analyzed by using short time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator to enhance the desired speech signal quality. This method is also based on statistical analysis. Doclo and Moonen further extended the Wiener method in the mutil-channel case [6]. Ephraim and Van Trees proposed the linear predictive factors to estimate the pure speech signal[7]. , Conventional speech enhancement method enhances the magnitude spectrum and usue the corrupted speech phase spectrum for signal recovery. Mainly, all the existing are used to change the magnitude spectrum of the speech signal because the phase spectrum provides less perceptual effect at high signal to noise ratio(SNR) level[8].Later, it has been found that phase spectrum is also helpful for  speech enhancement applications[9]. , This paper proposed a novel method by focusing on both components such as magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a speech signal to improve the quality and intelligibility of a speech signal. The quality of the sppech signal is measured by PESQ (Perceptual Estimation of Speech Quality) score compared with conventional methods. , 2. LITERATURE REVIEW i. Spectral subtractive algorithms: , In AMS (analysis–modification–synthesis) framework, the modulation domain processing was added by Paliwaland Schwerin[10]. To know the importance of the modulation stage for speech intelligibility, they had done three experiments, they are , 1. Investigate the relative contributions to intelligibility of the modulation magnitude , 2. Modulation phase, and  , 3. Acoustic phase spectra.   , In these 3 experiments they found that that the intelligibility of stimuli constructed from only y the modulation magnitude or phase spectra is significantly lower than the intelligibility of the acoustic magnitude spectrum. So here we can recognize that there is an effect of the modulation frame duration on intelligibility for both, the modulation magnitude and phase spectrum as the speech reconstructed from only the short-time modulation phase spectrum has highest intelligibility when long modulation frame durations (&gt;256 ms) are used. ii. Statistical-model-based algorithms , The effects of window shape and its length on the quality of phase-only and also magnitude-only reconstructed speech was investigated by Loveimi, Ahadi (Loveimi, Ahadi, 2010)[11]. The Speech signal is reconstructed through Least Square Error Estimation (LSEE) and Overlap Add (OLA) methods from its magnitude-only and phase-only spectra. If we want to reconstruct the speech from its magnitude spectrum they select sequence of random uniformly distributed numbers in the range of (−  , , ), as the phase sequence, or substitute phase spectrum with zero. iii. Subspace algorithms , The Combined TSP method gives a relatively better performance compared to temporal or spectral processing alone was invented by Krishnamoorthy &amp;  Prasanna[11]. They propose a noisy speech enhancement method by combining linear prediction (LP) residual weighting in the time domain and spectral processing in the frequency domain is used  to provide better noise suppression as well as better enhancement in the speech regions. By estimating the sum of the peaks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum, the gross level features are computed. Using the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation the fine level features are identified. This system is performed only on the high SNR regions of the spectrally processed speech. , 3. PROPOSED METHOD , In our proposed method a noisy speech signal is transformed into magnitude and phase spectrum to produce a modified complex spectrum to obtain better intelligibility and high speech quality. , The magnitude spectrum of clean speech is defined as  √2 2 1 2, 2 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 5  where ∙  and ∙  represents the modified Bessel functions of zero and first order, respectively.  can be defined as  , 1 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 6  , Implementation of Magnitude and Phase Spectrum Compensation to Achieve an Enhanced Speech Signal 113   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 where  and  can de defined as  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 7              , Fig. 1.

Zero weighting is applied to the values of  non conjugate vectors of DSTF transform (i.e,\\t 0 and 2⁄  for ).The next step is to generate a phase spectrum compensation to reduce the noise of the speech signal and to generate a complex spectrum. , , Λ , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 10  Now the phase spectrum compensation function is obtained by ∠ , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 11  ARG=complex angle function , The above equation is giving the information about magnitude estimation and compensated phase spectrum.

The output of this may be complex because it is in time representation. So in PSC method the imaginary part is removed. And the final result, i.e enhanced time domain signal is obtained by applying overlap-Add method procedure, ̂ . 4. DISCUSSION , 1. A clean speech is corrupted by the noise at the receiver section.

The proposed system aims to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks. The proposed system is tested on real time recognition from a web camera and on the publicly available dataset. , The experimental results, which were obtained on publicly available data sets of fingerprint and 2D face, show tha t the proposed method is highly competitive compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and the analysis of the general image quality of real biometric samples reveals highly valuable information which may be very efficiently used to discriminate them from fake traits.  , Index Terms- Attacks, biometrics, countermeasures, image quality assessment, security.   , I. INTRODUCTION  , The  interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security has been increasing day by day that  leads to the creation of numerous and very diverse initiatives that focused on this  field of research[1] that includes the publication of many research works disclosing and evaluating different biometric vulnerabilities[2], [3], the proposal of new protection methods[4, 5, 6],  related book chapters[7] the publication of several standards in the area, the dedication of specific track sessions and workshops in biometric-specific and general signal processing conferences[8, 19],and the organization of competitions that focused on vulnerability assessment, the acquisition of specific datasets, the creation of groups and the laboratories specialized in the evaluation of biometric security, or there may be the existence of several European , Projects with the biometric security topic as main research interest.  , The above all these initiatives clearly highlight the importance given by all parties that involved in the development of biometrics  to the improvement of the systems security that brings  rapidly emerging technology into practical use. The speed and very low complexity of the proposed technique is an added advantage that makes it very well suited to operate on real scenarios (one of the desired characteristics of this type of methods). As we know that it does not deploy  any trait-specific property (e.g., minutiae points or face detection), the computation load needed for image processing purposes is very reduced and by   using only general image quality measures fast to compute and combined with very simple classifiers. , The system has been tested on publicly available attack databases of fingerprint and 2D face and also on real time. The proposed system has reached results fully comparable to those obtained on the same databases and here we follow the same experimental protocols by more complex trait-specific top-ranked approaches from the state-of-the-art.  , II. LITERATURE SURVEY  , In the entitled Paper Javier (Galbally Z.Wei, 2014), introduced a novel software-based multi-biometric and multi-attack protection method that targets to overcome part of limitations through the use of image quality assessment (IQA). It is not capable of operating with a very good performance under different biometric systems and also for diverse spoofing scenarios. In the paper (Poonam Dabas , Z.Wei, 2013), introduced objective methods for measuring the quality of images. In this paper, the proposed method focused on the various quality measures and an algorithm to model HVS (Human , Visual System). The properties of HVS are perceived brightness and frequency response and HVS is used to process input images. , The Approach of this paper [9] is based on the fact that hiding information in digital media requires alterations of the signal properties that introduce some form of degradation. The addition of a watermark or message leaves unique artifacts that can be detected using Image Quality Measures (IQM) is shown in this paper. The paper proves that image quality assessment can be used to discriminate between cover images and , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 50 stego-images. The paper also proves that the hypothesis that message-embedding scheme leave statistical evidence or structure in images that can be exploited for detection. In this paper [9], a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications is proposed. The index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors:  , A. Loss of Correlation Here, the degree of linear correlation between x and y is measured. Its dynamic range [-1, 1].  , B. Luminance Distortion   It will measure how close the mean luminance is between x and y. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1].  , C. Contrast Distortion It will measure how much similar are the contrasts are. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1]. The paper proves that the index outperforms the traditional method of error calculation of images for quality.  , III. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR , LIVENESS DETECTION  , In this paper, we have assumption that: “It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed.” Here, expected quality differences between real and fake samples may include: degree of sharpness, color and luminance levels, local artifacts, amount of information found in both type of images (entropy), structural distortions or natural appearance like face images captured from a mobile device will probably be over- or under-exposed; and fingerprint images captured from a gummy finger present local acquisition artifacts such as spots and patches. By following this “quality-difference” hypothesis, in the present research work we explore the potential of general image quality assessment as a protection method against different biometric attacks. Since the implemented features do not evaluate any specific property of a given biometric modality or of a specific attack so they may be computed on any image and the proposed method gives a new multi-biometric dimension. In the proposed state-of-the-art, the reasons behind the use of IQA features for liveness detection is supported by three factors:  , 1. The previous works for image manipulation detection [11, 12], and steg analysis [13, 14] in the forensic field has successfully used image quality. To an extent, various spoofing attacks like  those which involve taking a picture of a facial image displayed in a 2D device (e.g., spoofing attacks with printed face images), may be regarded as a type of image manipulation which can be effectively detected, as shown in the proposed  research work, by the use of different quality features. , 2. The previous studies in the forensic area and different features measuring trait-specific quality properties have already been used for liveness detection purposes in fingerprint  applications [5].This work gives a solid basis to the use of image quality as a protection method in biometric systems. , 3. As human observers very often refer to the “different appearance” of real and fake samples to distinguish between them. So, different metrics and methods designed for IQA intend to estimate in an objective and reliable way the perceived appearance of images by humans. In the proposed system, we have used different quality measures to differentiate between real and fake images.  , IV. PROPOSED METHOD  , In this proposed method, we present a novel fake detection model which can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, using image quality assessment. In the designed system, for real time recognition, we are interfacing camera to Raspberry pi and the camera will capture face image of a person and send to controller. Face and iris of the person from the image will be recognized by the controller and the finger print module will take the finger print from the person and send to controller. Then after controller will recognize the finger print of person from the data base and if they are matched then it will display the data on display unit.   Fig.1 Architecture diagram for real time recognition from a   web camera  , A.  Proposed algorithm for real time recognition In real time recognition, at first we have collected at least 15 images from webcam and then after we have trained the collected images by using Linear , Discriminant Analysis and finally we have tested the image of the same person (again image is taken from webcam).We have grabbed fingerprint of the person , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 51 from fingerprint scanner. Step wise description is given below.  , 1) Proposed Face Recognition The process of putting a label to a known face is known as face recognition. The proposed algorithm includes the following four steps:  , I. Face Detection , II. Face preprocessing , III. Training real time faces using Linear , Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , IV. Face Recognition  , Face Detection , The process of locating a face region in an image is face detection. In the proposed system, we have used , Haar-based cascade classifier for face detection. This algorithm works for frontal faces, side-view faces, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  , Haar based cascade classifier: , It is an effective face detection method. At first, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) [15, , 19] to train the classifier. After that, we need to extract features from it. Following are the Haar features:   Fig.2.Haar features  , The above features are just like our convolutional kernel and each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. Then all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features. We need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles for each feature calculation. Integral images are introduced to solve this and it simplifies the calculation and among all calculated features, most of them are irrelevant. So we will get over 160000 features and among them, we have to select the best feature and to obtain the best feature, we apply each and every feature on all the training images. It finds the best threshold which will classify the faces to positive and negative for each feature. The concept of this classifier is that instead of using all features on a window, group the features into different stages of classifiers and apply one-by-one. , Haar based cascade classifier using openCV: , In openCV, XML files [15] are stored and contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. , There are many cascade classifier in openCV like face detector, eye detector, mouth detector, etc.  , Steps for Face Detection:  , Loading Haar detector: , Here, pre trained XML file is loaded to perform face detection.  a. Accessing the webcam , Here, we access the webcam from the computer to grab the image.  b. Detecting a face using the Haar Classifier , Before detecting face in camera frame, we should perform the following steps:  i. Grayscale color conversion , As face detection only works on grayscale images. , Therefore, we should convert the color camera frame to grayscale.  ii. Shrinking the camera image , The size of the input image determines the speed of face detection i.e. it is very slow for large images but it is very fast for small images and detection is fairly even for low resolution. Thus, we should shrink the camera image to a more reasonable size.   iii. Histogram equalization , We should perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast and brightness because face detection is not as reliable in low-light conditions. , After performing these above preprocessing steps, we can now detect the face.  iv) Face pre-processing , As face recognition is extremely vulnerable to changes in lighting conditions, face orientation, face expression, thus, it is very important to reduce these differences as much as possible. In the proposed system, we have used histogram equalization for face preprocessing. For our convenience, the proposed system only uses eye detection and we ignore other facial features like mouth, nose etc.  v) Eye detection , It is a very useful for face preprocessing, because for frontal faces we can always assume a person's eyes should be horizontal and on opposite locations of the face and should have a fairly standard position and size within a face, although there are changes in facial , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 52 expressions, lighting conditions, camera properties, distance to camera, and so on. We have used pre-trained XML files for eye detection. vi) Eye search regions , The proposed system shows both left and right eyes region with small rectangle when the system captures the image. After this step, we perform the following steps:  a) Geometrical transformation and cropping: It includes scaling, rotating, and translating the images so that the eyes are aligned and then followed by the removal of the forehead, chin, ears, and background from the face image.  b) Separate histogram equalization for left and right sides: This step standardizes the brightness and contrast on both the left- and right-hand sides of the face independently.  c) Smoothing: Here, the image noise using a bilateral filter is reduced.  d) Elliptical mask: Here, the elliptical mask removes some remaining hair and background from the face image.  vii) Training real time faces using LDA , We can easily collect the face from the camera. This step includes training phase and testing phase.  , Training phase: , Distinguishing between the faces from different people is training phase and collecting the faces from the camera is training set. After collecting faces from the camera, we should train the faces. , The proposed system is trained by using LDA.  , Linear Discriminant Analysis: , LDA is a powerful statistical face recognition technique that overcomes the limitation of Principle component analysis technique by applying the linear discriminant criterion [16].The criterion tries to maximize the ratio of the determinant of the between-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant of the within class scatter matrix of the projected samples. It helps to group images of the same class and separates images of different classes of the images. It is based on 1D eigenvector matrices that appear somewhat like faces when viewed as 2D images [12]. Its basic principle is that it calculates one special eigenvector and eigenvalue for each person. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to access internal data structures of LDA. These data structures are used for mathematical calculations. , These data structures are usually stored as floating-point numbers typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.They are often either a 1D row or column matrix.   viii) Face Recognition , In this step, we find that who a person is just from a facial image. Here we have used Fisher face algorithm for face recognition. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to recognize the faces. In openCV, there are many FaceRecognizer algorithms. , In our system, we have used Fisher face algorithm. , Face verification can be done to confirm if the result of the prediction is reliable or whether it should be taken as an unknown person.  , The facial verification can be done by reconstruction of facial images followed by calculating similarity between reconstructed images and input images. We use openCv functions to perform above steps. Thus, we have used fisher faces algorithm, it needs higher threshold so here we have used threshold, say 0.7.  , 2) Proposed Fingerprint recognition method Fingerprint is another biometric check to the system. , In the proposed system, we have used openCV for fingerprint. Here, we grab the fingerprint [18] of the person at registration time and then we verify the fingerprint at verification time in real time verification.  , Binarization:  , It is the process of converting a pixel image into binary image. At first, we grab the image from the fingerprint scanner and apply binarization. It enables us to remove any desired noise from the image and help us to make the contrast better between the kin and the wrinkled surface of the finger. In the proposed system, we have two phases: Register phase and another is verify phase.  , During register phase, fingerprint is grabbed from fingerprint scanner and features points are stored in the buffer in hexadecimal form. Now during verify phase, again the fingerprint is taken from fingerprint scanner and here also the feature points are stored in buffer in hexadecimal form. If the previous feature point values match with the current feature point then authentication is success otherwise authentication is failed.

PROPSED ALGORITHM FOR OFFLINE , DATASET  , In offline recognition, we have used publicly available dataset for both face and finger which is explained below.  , 1. Proposed Face Recognition: The proposed system includes mainly following three steps in face recognition: i)In first step, we have to find a good database of faces with multiple images for each individual. ii) The second step is to detect faces in the database images and use them to train the face recognizer. iii) The third step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.   , Dataset: , ...]</td>\n",

With a Vine video, Tumblr post, Instagram photo or a simple tweet, you can easily share to everyone on what's happening in your life or any news at this very moment.  Communication with followers becomes easy and direct : In addition to communicate easily with greater short and frequent posts, microblogging platforms can be used  easily to encourage and facilitate better  interaction  through liking, reblogging , tweeting , commenting and more.  Convenient using with mobile and tabs: Microblogging gains too much of attention in present days and the main cause behind this is increasing trends of mobile browsing. It is difficult to consume, interact and write long and lengthy blog post in a tab or smartphone that‟s why microblogging comes into play and provide small, easy and faster posts.  , Twitter , Twitter is an online microblogging service that allows users to read and write short sentences of length 140 characters called tweets. Twitter Inc. is located at San Francisco. Users should register first to post any message, whereas unregistered users can only read them. Users can access Twitter with the website interface, mobile application or SMS. Twitter was created by , Noah Glass, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey in , March 2006 and launched in July 2006. Twitter has 310 Million monthly active users, 1 billion unique visits monthly to sites with embedded tweets, 83% of active users access through mobile application, consists of 3500 employees around the world, more than 35 offices across the world, 79% accounts are from outside the U.S. , supports more than 40 languages and , 40% employees of Twitter are from technical background. All numbers approximate as of March 31, 2016. , The company experienced rapid initial growth. In year 2007 around 4,00,000 tweets were posted per quarter. In 2008 this extends to 10 million tweets a quarter. 50 millions tweets were posted per day in February 2010. 70000 applications were registered by company as March 2010. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:10       Figure 2: Twitter Logo , According to Twitter, 750 tweets are posted each second which equals to each day around 65 million tweets were posted as of , June 2010. On daily basis around 140 tweets were posted by , March 2011. In January 2009, since it gained a lot of popularity, , Twitter becomes third-highest online microblogging site, given by Compete.com. , The reason we are using microblogging and Twitter data are the following:  The scope of microblogging tends to grow bigger and bigger day by day. Easy to use and people can share and give opinions on a certain topic, thus it makes essential source.  Twitter generates vast number of messages that is increasing exponentially. The extracted data can be enormously large.  Twitter users varies from person to person as user can be politicians, film stars, celebrities, sportsmen and many leaders across the country. So, it contains all the messages of different caste, religion and sex.  Twitter users are all over the world so it contains data for different language.  , Sentiment Analysis , Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. Users share the things about their ongoing life, discuss current issues and variety of topics. , Independent to write in any format without following rules that makes this more popular than older blogging sites. Movies and product reviews easily available now a days or thoughts on religious and political issues, so it becomes essential sources of user sentiment and opinion. Data that are we using in our experiment are from Twitter, it contains a vast number of messages by large number of users created by themselves. , Messages can vary from public opinion to personal thought. , These microblogging sites are huge source of information and it is quite easy to say that there is a need for automating the sentiment analysis process as there is too much work involved in processing this information manually. Various approaches are practiced for the automation of this process like machine learning and natural language processing. Users are increasing day by day as the population and trend of using microblogging sites are increasing, so the data can be used in research purpose of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. , In the time of election every news channel show the exit polls of every political party. So, every political party willing to know how many are in favor can do so  with the help of microblogging sites where people will give their opinions about likes and dislikes of theirs party. These opinions will help parties to increase their voters. , The data we are using in this experiment are movie reviews. We have collected about 17000 movie reviews from Twitter. The movie reviews contains categorized in three ways: reviews of different movies. Reviews can be categorized in three ways: , 1. Positive reviews: Messages in which people liked the movie. , 2. Negative reviews: Messages in which people not liked the movie. , 3. Neutral reviews: Messages in which people do not have emotions or based on mere fact. , We have extracted 5000 each positive, negative and neutral reviews for training set and 2000 reviews will be used in test set. , We show comparison between the different machine learning classifiers and empirically conclude which will give the best result among these. , II. RESEARCH PROBLEM Problem Statement , Microblogging is type of blogging which consists of a limited number of words. Limitation of words determined by respective microblogging sites. It gives right to share his/her thoughts, opinions and sentiments in less number of words. It is one of the revolutionary things happening in the world of technology. , People these days depend upon microblogging sites such as , Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. to communicate with both relatives and rest of world. Here sentiments come into the play which will be shared by anyone in the time they feel and wanted it to be shared. Sentiments are nothing but feelings with respect to event or situation. Sentiment Analysis is to determine the opinion of user related to some event or the statement describe the emotion of the user i.e. what he/she feels about it. , The research on sentiment analysis has been going for a long time. Sentiment analysis in present day is a prominent issue in the field of research and technology. Due to day by day increase in the number of users on social networking websites, a huge amount of data produced in the form of text, audio, video and images. There is need to do sentiment analysis as texts in form of messages or posts to find whether the sentiment is negative, positive or neutral.  , Gap Analysis , A lot of research has been done in the area of sentiment analysis. , Many researchers used Part-Of-Speech and polarity based feature using supervised learning techniques for classifying. , Journal of Engineering Sciences Vol 9, Issue 2, 2018 , ISSN NO: 0377-9254                                     www.jespublication.com Page No:11      , Many automatic classifiers are proposed for classifying the texts in the given expressions but with the restricted domains, but there will be new informal words that are added to the present world which means something in the common social network, so there is a need to include all the common referred terms that are used in the social networking world.  , Objectives , The objectives of the paper has been discussed in the following points :- , 1. To explore, analyze and study the existing sentiment analysis detection techniques in the online microblogging network. , 2. To study how the tweets can be generated from the Twitter with the help of Java API. , 3. To implement and analyze the results achieved after applying the supervised , 4. Learning classifiers to the dataset.  , III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The main aim of this paper is to compare the results that are implemented with the help of supervised classifier. , The paper follows the following methodology : , 1. We have collected a corpus of positive, negative and neutral tweets with the help of Twitter4j java API from , Twitter. The size of our corpus is large. , 2. We then remove the stop words from the collected corpus to make the content free from commas, full stops etc. , 3. Lastly, we  apply machine learning algorithms to our training set first and then test set and compare the results. , With the help of results we evaluate which machine learning algorithm is best for classification of data.  , Preprocessing , Collection of data: We collected data from Twitter API named as Twitter4j using netbeans. given by using Hashtag(#) followed by the movie name like #FAN, #BajarangiBhaijaan, #TheJungleBook etc. Approx 17000 tweets have been collected from the various movie tweets. , Reviews can also be searched by #Hash tags followed by respective movie stars, directors, production‟s house and music record companies. In Twitter, hash tags become the necessary symbol to find about something and it gives user limit of 140 words to express their views and attitude.  , Normalization , We have found that to get desired results from the classifier we have to make sure that  the tweets can be processed properly. As tweets can be in user language, so we have to clean the data which is irrelevant to the classification. The things which can be irrelevant are as follows :-  URL: URLs in the message will not make any sense as it simply distracts the result of classifier.  Username: Removal of username can be necessary for cleaning purposes as it can effect falsely to our results.  Repeated characters: If the character is repeated more than two times then it can  comprise new word but the meaning is the same, so we have to eliminate that word and make the word genuine. For example „good‟ can be written as „gooooood‟.  , Repeated words If the message contains word which has appeared more than two times continuously then it has to be changed into two times. For example, „great great great great movie‟ can be converted to „great great movie‟.  , Removal of stop words , Stop words are words like “a”, ”is”, ”the”, “etc” etc; These words have nothing to do with the emotion , so has to be discarded from the message. Now, the next step is to train the data using supervised classifier.  , Machine Learning Techniques , We employed classification methods which is polarity based using set of positive, negative and neutral tweets provided by , Twitter4j API. Polarity is given by ratio of probability of a word appeared in set of positive or negative statement which makes the word positive or negative. The classifiers we are using are based on the concept of polarity. , If the feature is independent and based only on Standard English , ...]\n",

However, currently availab le algorithms focus basically on the recognition of modern coins. To date, no optical recognition system fo r coins has been researched successfully. In this paper, an algorithm based on unequally spaced frequency Fourier transforms is proposed for the recognition of coins. The performance of proposed algorithm is measured in terms of mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio.  Keywords : Coin, Feature Extraction, Neural Network, Recognition, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)  , I.   INTRODUCTION  , Coin recognition systems and coin sorting machines have become a vital part of our life. They are used in banks, supermarkets, grocery stores, vending machines etc. In-spite of daily uses, coin recognition systems can also be used for the research purpose by the organizations that deal with the ancient coins. The three main coin recognition systems are mechanical method based systems, electromagnetic method based systems and image processing based systems   [4]   [5].   , The   mechanical   method   based systems use parameters like diameter or radius, thickness, weight and magnetism of the coin to differentiate between the coins. But these parameters cannot be used to differentiate between the different materials of the coins i.e. if we provide two coins original and the fake having same diameter, thickness, weight and  magnetism but  with  different  materials then  such system will not be able to differentiate the original co in. The electromagnetic method based systems can differentiate between different materials because in these systems the coins are passed through an oscillating coil at a certain frequency and different materials bring d ifferent changes in the amplitude and direction of frequency. So these changes and the other parameters   like   diameter,   thickness,   weight   and magnetis m can be used to differentiate between coins. The electromagnetic based coin recognition systems improve the accuracy of recognition but still they can be fooled by some game co ins. In the recent years coin recognition systems based on images have also come into picture [8]. In these systems, first of all the image of the coin to be recognized is taken  either by camera or by some scanning. Then these images are processed by various image processing techniques like FFT, , DCT, edge detection, segmentation etc. and further various features are extracted from the images which are used to recognize different coins.  , II.        LITERATURE S URVEY  , An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) bas e d Automated Coin  , Recognition System [2] is proposed for the recognition of , Indian Coins of denomination `1, `2, `5 and `10 with rotation invariance. Since the images are  taken from  both  sides  of  coin,  so  this system  is  capable  of  recognizing  coins  from  both sides.  Features a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  i m a g e s  u s i n g  techniques    of    Hough    Transformat ion,    Pattern  , Averaging etc.  and then  the  extracted  features  are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. An algorithm for recognit ion of the co ins of d ifferent denomination is presented [3]. The proposed system first uses a canny edge detection to generate an edge map and then uses CHT (Circu lar Hough transform) to recognize the coins and further find the radii of them. In [1], authors presented an approach based on image subtraction technique for recognition of , Indian Coins. In [7], authors presented the coin identification approach in which images of coin are taken from different angles and a databank is created. By using this databank, data is providing to the neural network fo r its training. An image based approach for coin recognition using gabor wavelet for feature extract ion is provided [6].  , III.PROPOS ED COIN RECOGNITION S YSTEM  , The fo llowing  steps are performed  in  the proposed coin recognition system:  , Step 1:   Develop a RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLA B. , Step 2: The Pre-processing of a coin image is perfo rmed for recognizing the type of coin. , Step 3: Unequally spaced frequency Fourier transform is applied. , Step  4: The  training  &  testing  phase  of  neural network  with  rotation  invariance  is  applied  during coin recognition. , Step 5:  The results are displayed in the form of MSE and , PSNR , In this section we present recent approaches for coin recognition techniques, namely algorithms based on the , Eigen space approach, gradient features, contour and texture features. Finally, we discuss some preliminary   results   of   tests   performed   on   the muscle cis coin dataset.  , Research Article                                                                                                                              Volume 7 Issue No.4    , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10310                                                                 http://ijesc.org/    , 3.1 Coin detection , Hough transform is based on feature points extracted from the original image and usually, edges are used as the feature points. Various edge detection methods have been used for different applications. If Sobel filter is used to a coin image, large number of edge points are obtained from texture of the coin can be regarded as noise, which will induce a huge overhead   in   the   execution   time   of   the   Hough transform and most importantly will produce measurement errors, so technique to reduce the unwanted edge is sought. , Fig. 2 shows the result of applying Sobel filters to given input image (Fig. 1). The canny edge detector is very powerful tool for detecting edges in a noisy environment. Canny edge detector can remove most of the edge points. Canny gives thin edge as compared to the Sobel. Hence, canny edge detector has used for eliminating the unwanted edges that can result from , Sobel. Based on the smoothed image, derivatives in both the x and y direction are computed, these in turn are used to compute the gradient magnitude of the image.  Once the gradient magnitude of the image has been c o m p u t e d , a  p r o c e s s  c a l l e d  n o n  m a x i m u m  suppression is performed; in which pixels are suppressed if they do not constitute a local maximum.   Figure.1. Sample Coin image   Figure.2. Result of Sobel Filter   Figure.3. Result of Canny Edge Detection.  , The final step in the canny edge detector is to use hysteresis operator, in which p ixels are marked as edges, non edges and in-between based on threshold values. The next step is to consider each of the pixels that are in-between, if they are connected to edge pixels these are marked as edge pixels as well. The result of this edge detector is a binary image in which the white pixels closely approximate the true edges of the original image as shown in , Fig. 3.  , 3.2Coin verification , In general the appearance of one coin pattern varies considerably with respect to its grey values. These variations frequently are inhomogeneous and this suggests  that  fo r recognit ion  purposes, grey values by themselves will not give us appropriate results. On the other hand, edge information  remains more or less stable or at least degrades gracefully. So  the proposed research work is based on the detection on  edges.  In princip le any edge detector may be used for this purpose but Canny edge operator and the Laplacian of , Gaussian method provides more satisfactory results. As a result of the edge operator we either get a binary (edge) image or a list of coord inates at edge pixel locations.  , Let I : M× N → R[0,1] be an intensity image. M× N gives the  index space and  R[0,1] are  the  intensity values taken from the closed interval [0, 1]. E(x, y) ={ 1, if I(x, y) is an edge point , 0, els e   , 3.3 Coin recognition , Neural networks  give effect ive  resu lts fo r solving mult iple  class classification problems. Neural network has three types of layers: input layer, output layers and hidden layers. Hidden layer does intermediate computation before direct ing the input to output layer. Back propagation can also be considered as a generalization of delta rule. When back propagation network is cycled, an input pattern is propagated forward to the output units through the intervening input to hidden and hidden to output weights. Neural network have been widely used in image and signal processing. In our proposed work, neural network with rotation invariance is applied during coin recognition.  , IV .RES ULTS &DISCUSS ION  , 4.1 Performance metrics , MSE and PSNR are the two error metrics used to compare image quality. The MSE represents the cumulative squared error between the compressed and the original image, whereas , PSNR represents a measure of the peak error and these can be computed as:   In above equation, M and N are the number of rows and columns in the input images, respectively. PSNR can be calculated as: In   the   previous   equation,   R   is   the   maximum fluctuation in the input image e.g. if the input image has a double-precision floating data type, then R is 1. If it has an 8-bit unsigned integer data type, R is 255.    , 4.2 Experimental results  , Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of the outcomes of the proposed coin recognition system used for identifying the coin by using the neural networks.   , International Journal of Engineering Science  and Computing, April 2017         10311                                                                 http://ijesc.org/   Figure.4.

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  , Index Terms—Computer vision, Edge detection, Image processing, Pixel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , Date of Submission: 10-10-2020                                                                           Date of Acceptance: 26-10-2020 , ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  , I. Introduction The edge detection methods has a significant role in image processing work. By using image processing, we can use computational power for variety of applications [6]. We can use edge detection techniques in different fields of industry and agriculture [16]. The purpose of edge detection is to point out the differences and to identify the physical occurrence which produces them. Image edge information contains a lot of information [4]. Edge detection must be convenient because the validity, competence, and probability of the completion of successive processing phase depends on it. The segregation of the image into the background and object is a critical step in the image interpretation. Edges are the boundary between different textures. Edge is the discontinuities in the image intensity from one pixel to another. Detection of the edges for an image may help for data compression, data segmentation, and image reconstruction [2]. Edge detection is difficult in the noisy image since both the noise and edge contain high-frequency contents. Attempt to reduce the noise results makes the image more noisy and result in distorted image. Filters are used in the process of identifying the images by pointing and locating the discontinuities which brings the changes into pixel intensity are the boundary of an image. We always need a good edges for higher level processing.  An accurate and fast edge detector can upgrade the performance for complete processing system [19]. There are a lot of edge detection techniques available and each designed with a certain type of features. Since basic of image processing for object detection is edge detection, it is pivotal to have a good grasp of the edges detection techniques. In the fig. 1, the gradient vector of an edge pixel is shown. The intensity for each pixel changes from 0 to 255 in the gradient direction. strength of the edge is indicated by the magnitude of the gradient. An edge pixel is identified by using two traits, the edge strength which is the magnitude of the gradient, and the edge direction which is the angle of the gradient.

Operators can be easily optimized to look for diagonal, vertical, or horizontal edges. There are many ways to perform edge detection, but the majority of the techniques can be classified into two groups: · Gradient-based edge detection: The gradient method finds edge by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. · Laplacian based edge detection: The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image [14-17]. An edge has the shape of a ramp which is one-dimensional and location can be easily highlighted by calculating the derivative of the image [11]. Assume we have the following signal, with an edge shown by the jump in intensity below:   Fig.2 Intensity jump  , If we consider the gradient of this signal (which, in one dimension, is just the first derivative concerning for to t) we get the following:     Fig.3 First derivative  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              8 | Page , II. Methodology 1. There are a lot of problems due to false edge detection, missing true edges, in edge detection techniques production of thick or thin lines are problems due to noise.  The visual comparison is analyzed in this paper which is the most  used Laplacian and Gradient-based Edge Detection techniques for problems of faulty edge detection, missing real edges, problems due to noise, and producing thick or thin lines, etc. In this paper, different edge detection algorithms are compared to find an efficient and superior edge detection algorithm. , Different edge detection method , 2.  , 2.1 Sobel operator Sobel edge detection is considered a traditional method used in image processing techniques. The Sobel kernels are suitable to detect edges along the vertical and horizontal axis. The Sobel operator is based on convolving the image with a separable, small, and integer-valued filter [13]. The Sobel uses two pairs of 3x3 kernels for x and y-direction.                                         , -1  0  +1  , -2  0  +2  , -1  0  +1  +1  +2  +1  , 0  0  0  , -1  -2  -1      , Table.1 x-direction   Table.2 y-direction the kernel is rotated by 90°.  This method is used to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction of each image pixel. The magnitude of the vector is given as:     ∆f = mag(∆f) = [Gx, 2+GY, 2]½………………….(1)  , 1.2 Prewitt edge detection , Prewitt edge method matches with Sobel edge method. Prewitt edge detection masks are one of the old and well-understood methods of detecting edges in images. It is widely used for detecting horizontal and vertical edges and gives those points where there is maximum gradient [12]. The strength of the edge at the given point is then the square root of the sum of the squares of two derivatives. , 1.3 Canny edge detector , Canny edge detection detects a wide range of edges in image. It is a multi-step algorithm which can detect edges with noise suppressed at the time [5]. It was proposed to buy Canny in 1986. the initial level, it applies a , Gaussian filter that smooths the image to wipe out the noise. The main problem with this type of edge detection approach is a high threshold misses important edges and a low threshold produces false. , 1.4 Robert edge detection , This operator executes a gradient detection using the difference between adjacent pixels in the diagonal direction [3]. In Robert edge detection, the horizontal and vertical edges are calculated individually and then put together for resulting edge detection [18]. It approximates the gradient intensity in discrete differentiation, which is obtained by the summation of squares of differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. The Roberts edge detector computes 2-D spatial gradient on the image [8]. It uses a pair of 2x2 convoluted kernels, which is like a , Sobel edge method. Roberts x, y kernels is mentioned below:                                                                                                                                                 Table.3 Gx                    Table.4 Gy   1.5 Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) , This method of edge detection was invented in 1980 by Marr and Hildreth. In this method, the Laplacian is combined with Gaussian filtering change the image where the intensity varies to detect the edges effectively. It finds the actual place of edges and testing large area around the pixels. The disadvantage of the LOG operator is that it cannot find out the orientation of edge because of the Laplacian filter. The use of gaussian operator in , LOG  formulation is to smooth the image and  use the zero crossing to the location of edges [7].   All of these techniques can be grouped into three modules      • Gradient (estimate of the 1stderivative)        • Laplacian (Zero crossing detectors) derivative)         • Image approximation algorithm +1  0    0  1  , 0  +1    -1  0  , Evaluation and Comparative Study of Edge Detection Techniques , DOI: 10.9790/0661-2205030615                               www.iosrjournals.org                                              9 | Page                 , Table.5  , 3. Mathematical morphological operators In a morphological operation, each and every pixel in the image is compared based on the value of other pixels in its area of neighbourhood [1]. A structuring element is a special filtering tool that enhances an input image. It can be of different sizes and different shapes. In mathematical morphology, a gradient image can be considered as a topological surface where the numerical value of each pixel indicates the evaluation of their points [10]. , These are Some of the main mathematical morphological operators: , 2.1 Dilation , It is the highest value in the window. The image after dilation becomes brighter or the intensity increases because of the maximum value in the window. It expands the image and is mainly used to fill the gap. Dilation process expands image objects by changing pixels with a value of “1” from“0”. , 2.2 Erosion , It is not at all similar to dilation. It is the lowest value in the window. The image after Erosion will be darker than the original image. It shrinks or thins the image. This process shrinking objects or images by changing pixels with a value of “1” to “0”. , 2.3 Opening and closing , Both opening and closing parameters are formed by using erosion and dilation. In the opening, firstly image will be eroded and then it will be followed by dilation. And in case of closing, firstly image will be dilated and then followed by erosion. , A. Mean Squared Error , The average of the squares of the \"errors\" is measured by the mean squared error of an estimator i.e. the difference between what is estimated and estimator. The contrast happens due to randomness or as a result of the estimator doesn’t calculate information that could result in a better accurate estimate. The PSNR differ inversely with the MSE. , The mean square error is the squared error averaged over the M × N array.  , MSE=1/MN ∑ ∑ (f1(m,n)- f2(m,n))2 ………………….(1)     Where f1 (m, n) and  f2 (m, n) are the output and input images respectively and M, N are the dimensions of the image. Its value must be less. , RMSE=√MSE , B. Peak signal to noise ratio , Peak signal to noise ratio is the ratio between the power of corrupting noise and the most significant possible power of a signal. It is represented by PSNR. Here, PSNR refers to the ratio between the edge detected images i.e. the estimator output and the ground truth image which is also referred to be the estimated image. It is the logarithmic function of the peak value of the image and the mean square error. Usually, PSNR is expressed in decibel scale. PSNR can be rated by the following Equation 2: , PSNR=10 LOG(2552/MSE) ………………….(2) , Where MSE is mean square error. Its value must be high.  , Original images are shown below and algorithms are applied to it.

Comparison of Techniques          , Table.6  , For image 1 we have calculated MSE and PSNR for different methods of different edge detection techniques. In the experimental analysis, we came across to analyze that canny operators have been the most efficient and effective method for the detection of edges. Different edge detectors works better under the different cases and conditions, there cannot be any algorithm that make use of multiple edge detectors [15].           , Table.7  , Similarly, we have to calculate the same for image 2. Under this experimental analysis, we find the same that the canny operator for this method has worked out well in all aspects. , We obtained different images for different edge detection techniques. All of them are different in some aspects and the most efficient method is the canny edge detection technique in both cases. All other methods have some blur and noisy labels that affect the efficiency of the image as compared to the canny edge detection techniques.     , 7.  , ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Removal of background noise is one of the crucial task because the speech signal should not be harmed by noise signal. Typically many speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed by concentrating only on short-time magnitude spectrum or else by compensating the phase spectrum by keeping the magnitude spectrum unchanged. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique by changing both magnitude and phase spectra  to improve the quality of a speech signal by producing an modified complex spectrum. In simulation results, both objective speech quality measure PESQ and spectrogram analysis has shown the performance of an enhanced speech signal.  Keywords - speech enhancement, magnitude spectrum, phase spectrum compensation. , 1. INTRODUCTION , Speech enhancement is nothing but noise suppression technology. It perceives most  important significance to improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signal in the noise environments. Natural background noises are sounds better when compared to unwanted twisted noises such as  traffic sounds, music sounds, some other person is speaking in the background etc, which may degrades the perceptual quality and intelligibility of the desired speech signal.  , Enhancement of speech signal is based on magnitude and phase spectrum compensation to restore the original signal from several background noises. , Let the noisy speech be defined as \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 1  where  represents discrete-time signals of noisy speech,  represents original speech  represents noise component. , The discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a set of real and complex numbers of  to produce a periodic function of frequency variable. Therefore, the DSTFT of the corrupted speech signal is defined as , ⁄ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2  where  defines as the kth discrete frequency of uniformly spaced  frequencies and  is an analysis window function. Therefore by using DSTF transform Eq.(1) can be represented as , , , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 3  where , , ,  and ,  represents DSTF transform’s of the total noise speech,  clean speech, and noise, respectively. The above equation is determined to describe each part of the speech signal in terms of the DSTFT magnitude spectrum and the DSTFT phase spectrum. Here, the clean speech signal ,  can be represented in terms of polar form as , | , | , \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4  where | , | is the magnitude spectrum, and ∠ ,  is the phase spectrum. , Many of the existing speech enhancement algorithms to remove the noisy speech as well as to look at the effects of intelligibility of speech signal to improve the quality of the speech signal. Actually, the speech signal is converted into polar form to generate magnitude and phase spectrum of the speech signal with respect to frequency. Here, many of the speech models has been proposed for speech enhancement, which is based only on the statistical model of magnitude to produce a modified complex spectrum. Thus, the modified complex spectrum is known as the estimated clean speech spectrum. , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 112, The following are some of the existing speech enhancement algorithm which is used to change only the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech signal and then combines with the unchanged phase spectrum to form a modified complex spectrum. Boll proposed Spectral subtraction (SSUB) in 1979. The basic idea of this method is that the noisy speech signal is the combination of both clean speech and noise as shown in Eqn.(1). Now, the magnitude spectrum of noise is get subtracted by the magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech. Therefore, the resultant magnitude spectrum of clean speech is combines with the unchanged phase spectrum[2] to obtain modified complex spectrum. Wiener filter[4]was proposed by Wiener. Hansen and Jensen. The basic principle of the weiner filter is to obtain an estimate of clean signal from the signal corrupted by the noise component. The estimate clean speech is obtained by minimizing the mean square error(MSE) between the desired signal  and the estimated signal ̂ . The MMSE estimator[3], which is presented by Ephraim and Malah in 1984. The MMSE method is analyzed by using short time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimator to enhance the desired speech signal quality. This method is also based on statistical analysis. Doclo and Moonen further extended the Wiener method in the mutil-channel case [6]. Ephraim and Van Trees proposed the linear predictive factors to estimate the pure speech signal[7]. , Conventional speech enhancement method enhances the magnitude spectrum and usue the corrupted speech phase spectrum for signal recovery. Mainly, all the existing are used to change the magnitude spectrum of the speech signal because the phase spectrum provides less perceptual effect at high signal to noise ratio(SNR) level[8].Later, it has been found that phase spectrum is also helpful for  speech enhancement applications[9]. , This paper proposed a novel method by focusing on both components such as magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a speech signal to improve the quality and intelligibility of a speech signal. The quality of the sppech signal is measured by PESQ (Perceptual Estimation of Speech Quality) score compared with conventional methods. , 2. LITERATURE REVIEW i. Spectral subtractive algorithms: , In AMS (analysis–modification–synthesis) framework, the modulation domain processing was added by Paliwaland Schwerin[10]. To know the importance of the modulation stage for speech intelligibility, they had done three experiments, they are , 1. Investigate the relative contributions to intelligibility of the modulation magnitude , 2. Modulation phase, and  , 3. Acoustic phase spectra.   , In these 3 experiments they found that that the intelligibility of stimuli constructed from only y the modulation magnitude or phase spectra is significantly lower than the intelligibility of the acoustic magnitude spectrum. So here we can recognize that there is an effect of the modulation frame duration on intelligibility for both, the modulation magnitude and phase spectrum as the speech reconstructed from only the short-time modulation phase spectrum has highest intelligibility when long modulation frame durations (>256 ms) are used. ii. Statistical-model-based algorithms , The effects of window shape and its length on the quality of phase-only and also magnitude-only reconstructed speech was investigated by Loveimi, Ahadi (Loveimi, Ahadi, 2010)[11]. The Speech signal is reconstructed through Least Square Error Estimation (LSEE) and Overlap Add (OLA) methods from its magnitude-only and phase-only spectra. If we want to reconstruct the speech from its magnitude spectrum they select sequence of random uniformly distributed numbers in the range of (−  , , ), as the phase sequence, or substitute phase spectrum with zero. iii. Subspace algorithms , The Combined TSP method gives a relatively better performance compared to temporal or spectral processing alone was invented by Krishnamoorthy &  Prasanna[11]. They propose a noisy speech enhancement method by combining linear prediction (LP) residual weighting in the time domain and spectral processing in the frequency domain is used  to provide better noise suppression as well as better enhancement in the speech regions. By estimating the sum of the peaks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum, the gross level features are computed. Using the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation the fine level features are identified. This system is performed only on the high SNR regions of the spectrally processed speech. , 3.

To improve the quality of a speech signal as well as the intelligibility proposed method is implemented. , 2. Many of the previous methods are used to operate only on short timemagnitude spectrum by keeping short time phase spectrum to enhance the quality of the speech signal. , 3. In the proposed method both the magnitude and phase spectrum compensation are implemented to denoise the signal and to avoid the complexities usually occurred in speech processing. , 4. Proposed method provides better noise cancellation when compared to the existing methods. , 5. The results were analyzed mainly by mean PESQ scores and spectrograms were used to present the performance on objective quality and speech intelligibility. , Overlap-Add, Noisy speech  , | , | ,  , DSTFT ∠ Λ , Λ ,  Phase spectrum compensation Λ , , Λ ,  , Magnitude estimator  , Modified complex spectrum , ∠ Λ ,  , IDSTFT, Enhanced speech ̂  , Sakil Ansari   , Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSIT) p-ISSN: 2393-9907; e-ISSN: 2393-9915; Volume 4, Issue 2; January-March, 2017 , 114, 5.

The proposed system aims to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks. The proposed system is tested on real time recognition from a web camera and on the publicly available dataset. , The experimental results, which were obtained on publicly available data sets of fingerprint and 2D face, show tha t the proposed method is highly competitive compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and the analysis of the general image quality of real biometric samples reveals highly valuable information which may be very efficiently used to discriminate them from fake traits.  , Index Terms- Attacks, biometrics, countermeasures, image quality assessment, security.   , I. INTRODUCTION  , The  interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security has been increasing day by day that  leads to the creation of numerous and very diverse initiatives that focused on this  field of research[1] that includes the publication of many research works disclosing and evaluating different biometric vulnerabilities[2], [3], the proposal of new protection methods[4, 5, 6],  related book chapters[7] the publication of several standards in the area, the dedication of specific track sessions and workshops in biometric-specific and general signal processing conferences[8, 19],and the organization of competitions that focused on vulnerability assessment, the acquisition of specific datasets, the creation of groups and the laboratories specialized in the evaluation of biometric security, or there may be the existence of several European , Projects with the biometric security topic as main research interest.  , The above all these initiatives clearly highlight the importance given by all parties that involved in the development of biometrics  to the improvement of the systems security that brings  rapidly emerging technology into practical use. The speed and very low complexity of the proposed technique is an added advantage that makes it very well suited to operate on real scenarios (one of the desired characteristics of this type of methods). As we know that it does not deploy  any trait-specific property (e.g., minutiae points or face detection), the computation load needed for image processing purposes is very reduced and by   using only general image quality measures fast to compute and combined with very simple classifiers. , The system has been tested on publicly available attack databases of fingerprint and 2D face and also on real time. The proposed system has reached results fully comparable to those obtained on the same databases and here we follow the same experimental protocols by more complex trait-specific top-ranked approaches from the state-of-the-art.  , II. LITERATURE SURVEY  , In the entitled Paper Javier (Galbally Z.Wei, 2014), introduced a novel software-based multi-biometric and multi-attack protection method that targets to overcome part of limitations through the use of image quality assessment (IQA). It is not capable of operating with a very good performance under different biometric systems and also for diverse spoofing scenarios. In the paper (Poonam Dabas , Z.Wei, 2013), introduced objective methods for measuring the quality of images. In this paper, the proposed method focused on the various quality measures and an algorithm to model HVS (Human , Visual System). The properties of HVS are perceived brightness and frequency response and HVS is used to process input images. , The Approach of this paper [9] is based on the fact that hiding information in digital media requires alterations of the signal properties that introduce some form of degradation. The addition of a watermark or message leaves unique artifacts that can be detected using Image Quality Measures (IQM) is shown in this paper. The paper proves that image quality assessment can be used to discriminate between cover images and , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 50 stego-images. The paper also proves that the hypothesis that message-embedding scheme leave statistical evidence or structure in images that can be exploited for detection. In this paper [9], a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications is proposed. The index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors:  , A. Loss of Correlation Here, the degree of linear correlation between x and y is measured. Its dynamic range [-1, 1].  , B. Luminance Distortion   It will measure how close the mean luminance is between x and y. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1].  , C. Contrast Distortion It will measure how much similar are the contrasts are. Here the dynamic range is [0, 1]. The paper proves that the index outperforms the traditional method of error calculation of images for quality.  , III. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR , LIVENESS DETECTION  , In this paper, we have assumption that: “It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed.” Here, expected quality differences between real and fake samples may include: degree of sharpness, color and luminance levels, local artifacts, amount of information found in both type of images (entropy), structural distortions or natural appearance like face images captured from a mobile device will probably be over- or under-exposed; and fingerprint images captured from a gummy finger present local acquisition artifacts such as spots and patches. By following this “quality-difference” hypothesis, in the present research work we explore the potential of general image quality assessment as a protection method against different biometric attacks. Since the implemented features do not evaluate any specific property of a given biometric modality or of a specific attack so they may be computed on any image and the proposed method gives a new multi-biometric dimension. In the proposed state-of-the-art, the reasons behind the use of IQA features for liveness detection is supported by three factors:  , 1. The previous works for image manipulation detection [11, 12], and steg analysis [13, 14] in the forensic field has successfully used image quality. To an extent, various spoofing attacks like  those which involve taking a picture of a facial image displayed in a 2D device (e.g., spoofing attacks with printed face images), may be regarded as a type of image manipulation which can be effectively detected, as shown in the proposed  research work, by the use of different quality features. , 2. The previous studies in the forensic area and different features measuring trait-specific quality properties have already been used for liveness detection purposes in fingerprint  applications [5].This work gives a solid basis to the use of image quality as a protection method in biometric systems. , 3. As human observers very often refer to the “different appearance” of real and fake samples to distinguish between them. So, different metrics and methods designed for IQA intend to estimate in an objective and reliable way the perceived appearance of images by humans. In the proposed system, we have used different quality measures to differentiate between real and fake images.  , IV. PROPOSED METHOD  , In this proposed method, we present a novel fake detection model which can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The goal of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, using image quality assessment. In the designed system, for real time recognition, we are interfacing camera to Raspberry pi and the camera will capture face image of a person and send to controller. Face and iris of the person from the image will be recognized by the controller and the finger print module will take the finger print from the person and send to controller. Then after controller will recognize the finger print of person from the data base and if they are matched then it will display the data on display unit.   Fig.1 Architecture diagram for real time recognition from a   web camera  , A.  Proposed algorithm for real time recognition In real time recognition, at first we have collected at least 15 images from webcam and then after we have trained the collected images by using Linear , Discriminant Analysis and finally we have tested the image of the same person (again image is taken from webcam).We have grabbed fingerprint of the person , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 51 from fingerprint scanner. Step wise description is given below.  , 1) Proposed Face Recognition The process of putting a label to a known face is known as face recognition. The proposed algorithm includes the following four steps:  , I. Face Detection , II. Face preprocessing , III. Training real time faces using Linear , Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , IV. Face Recognition  , Face Detection , The process of locating a face region in an image is face detection. In the proposed system, we have used , Haar-based cascade classifier for face detection. This algorithm works for frontal faces, side-view faces, eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  , Haar based cascade classifier: , It is an effective face detection method. At first, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) [15, , 19] to train the classifier. After that, we need to extract features from it. Following are the Haar features:   Fig.2.Haar features  , The above features are just like our convolutional kernel and each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. Then all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features. We need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles for each feature calculation. Integral images are introduced to solve this and it simplifies the calculation and among all calculated features, most of them are irrelevant. So we will get over 160000 features and among them, we have to select the best feature and to obtain the best feature, we apply each and every feature on all the training images. It finds the best threshold which will classify the faces to positive and negative for each feature. The concept of this classifier is that instead of using all features on a window, group the features into different stages of classifiers and apply one-by-one. , Haar based cascade classifier using openCV: , In openCV, XML files [15] are stored and contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. , There are many cascade classifier in openCV like face detector, eye detector, mouth detector, etc.  , Steps for Face Detection:  , Loading Haar detector: , Here, pre trained XML file is loaded to perform face detection.  a. Accessing the webcam , Here, we access the webcam from the computer to grab the image.  b. Detecting a face using the Haar Classifier , Before detecting face in camera frame, we should perform the following steps:  i. Grayscale color conversion , As face detection only works on grayscale images. , Therefore, we should convert the color camera frame to grayscale.  ii. Shrinking the camera image , The size of the input image determines the speed of face detection i.e. it is very slow for large images but it is very fast for small images and detection is fairly even for low resolution. Thus, we should shrink the camera image to a more reasonable size.   iii. Histogram equalization , We should perform histogram equalization to improve the contrast and brightness because face detection is not as reliable in low-light conditions. , After performing these above preprocessing steps, we can now detect the face.  iv) Face pre-processing , As face recognition is extremely vulnerable to changes in lighting conditions, face orientation, face expression, thus, it is very important to reduce these differences as much as possible. In the proposed system, we have used histogram equalization for face preprocessing. For our convenience, the proposed system only uses eye detection and we ignore other facial features like mouth, nose etc.  v) Eye detection , It is a very useful for face preprocessing, because for frontal faces we can always assume a person's eyes should be horizontal and on opposite locations of the face and should have a fairly standard position and size within a face, although there are changes in facial , International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, ISSN: 2394-2835 Volume-4, Issue-5, May-2017 http://iraj.in , Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Fingerprint and Face Recognition  , 52 expressions, lighting conditions, camera properties, distance to camera, and so on. We have used pre-trained XML files for eye detection. vi) Eye search regions , The proposed system shows both left and right eyes region with small rectangle when the system captures the image. After this step, we perform the following steps:  a) Geometrical transformation and cropping: It includes scaling, rotating, and translating the images so that the eyes are aligned and then followed by the removal of the forehead, chin, ears, and background from the face image.  b) Separate histogram equalization for left and right sides: This step standardizes the brightness and contrast on both the left- and right-hand sides of the face independently.  c) Smoothing: Here, the image noise using a bilateral filter is reduced.  d) Elliptical mask: Here, the elliptical mask removes some remaining hair and background from the face image.  vii) Training real time faces using LDA , We can easily collect the face from the camera. This step includes training phase and testing phase.  , Training phase: , Distinguishing between the faces from different people is training phase and collecting the faces from the camera is training set. After collecting faces from the camera, we should train the faces. , The proposed system is trained by using LDA.  , Linear Discriminant Analysis: , LDA is a powerful statistical face recognition technique that overcomes the limitation of Principle component analysis technique by applying the linear discriminant criterion [16].The criterion tries to maximize the ratio of the determinant of the between-class scatter matrix of the projected samples to the determinant of the within class scatter matrix of the projected samples. It helps to group images of the same class and separates images of different classes of the images. It is based on 1D eigenvector matrices that appear somewhat like faces when viewed as 2D images [12]. Its basic principle is that it calculates one special eigenvector and eigenvalue for each person. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to access internal data structures of LDA. These data structures are used for mathematical calculations. , These data structures are usually stored as floating-point numbers typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.They are often either a 1D row or column matrix.   viii) Face Recognition , In this step, we find that who a person is just from a facial image. Here we have used Fisher face algorithm for face recognition. In the proposed system, we have used openCV function to recognize the faces. In openCV, there are many FaceRecognizer algorithms. , In our system, we have used Fisher face algorithm. , Face verification can be done to confirm if the result of the prediction is reliable or whether it should be taken as an unknown person.  , The facial verification can be done by reconstruction of facial images followed by calculating similarity between reconstructed images and input images. We use openCv functions to perform above steps. Thus, we have used fisher faces algorithm, it needs higher threshold so here we have used threshold, say 0.7.  , 2) Proposed Fingerprint recognition method Fingerprint is another biometric check to the system. , In the proposed system, we have used openCV for fingerprint. Here, we grab the fingerprint [18] of the person at registration time and then we verify the fingerprint at verification time in real time verification.  , Binarization:  , It is the process of converting a pixel image into binary image. At first, we grab the image from the fingerprint scanner and apply binarization. It enables us to remove any desired noise from the image and help us to make the contrast better between the kin and the wrinkled surface of the finger. In the proposed system, we have two phases: Register phase and another is verify phase.  , During register phase, fingerprint is grabbed from fingerprint scanner and features points are stored in the buffer in hexadecimal form. Now during verify phase, again the fingerprint is taken from fingerprint scanner and here also the feature points are stored in buffer in hexadecimal form. If the previous feature point values match with the current feature point then authentication is success otherwise authentication is failed.

PROPSED ALGORITHM FOR OFFLINE , DATASET  , In offline recognition, we have used publicly available dataset for both face and finger which is explained below.  , 1. Proposed Face Recognition: The proposed system includes mainly following three steps in face recognition: i)In first step, we have to find a good database of faces with multiple images for each individual. ii) The second step is to detect faces in the database images and use them to train the face recognizer. iii) The third step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.   , Dataset: , ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "

In image analysis, edge detection is one of the most commonly and frequently used operation, and there are probably some more algorithms in the literature for enhancing and detecting edges. Edge detection is the method of  pointing and detecting sharp discontinuities in an image. The gap or discontinuities are unexpected changes in the intensity of pixel which distinguish boundaries of objects in a images. Edges form the outline of an object which is the main reason behind boundaries of objects in a scene. An edge is a borderline between object and its background which means if detection of an edge can be done then the respective object can be found and properties like area, the perimeter can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detections are a fundamental and essential tool. Here, we have evaluated several techniques of edge detection with different images in  image processing.  ',\n",
